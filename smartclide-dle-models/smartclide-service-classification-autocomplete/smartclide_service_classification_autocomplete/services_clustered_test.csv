CPA adalah alat pertama yang dirilis sebagai open source yang dapat menjamin ** 100% ** bahwa kode pin Anda akan retak selama debugging usb telah diaktifkan. ########################################################## CPA will allways try to bring support for rare protocols, CPA wont contain common stuff like other brute tools cover like facebook, snapchat, instagram and you name it (except a few exceptions, very few) CPA akan selalu mencoba untuk memberikan dukungan untuk protokol langka, wCPA tidak akan berisi hal-hal umum seperti sampul alat kasar lainnya seperti facebook, snapchat, instagram dan sebut saja (kecuali beberapa pengecualian, sangat sedikit) ########################################################## _Many times it's the easiest methods that are the most powerful methods, it's just a matter of using your imagination ;-)_  Sering kali ini adalah metode termudah yang merupakan metode paling kuat, itu hanya masalah menggunakan imajinasi Anda ;-) ########################################################## ## INFO: 2020-07-11:  Android and Google, now have set a rule for locksettings via cli as via gui earlier, if you try to many attempts within X seconds you will be blocked for X seconds so wbruter via cli wont work anymore on devices that has been upgraded to latest version Android 10, older version should work fine unless they are upgraded to latest android version.   Android dan Google, sekarang telah menetapkan aturan untuk penguncian melalui cli seperti melalui gui sebelumnya, jika Anda mencoba banyak upaya dalam 10 detik Anda akan diblokir selama 10 detik sehingga wbruter melalui cli tidak akan berfungsi lagi pada perangkat yang telah ditingkatkan ke versi terbaru Android 10, versi yang lebih lama seharusnya berfungsi dengan baik kecuali mereka ditingkatkan ke versi android terbaru. ########################################################## ## Enable USB-Debugging via the methods below:  #### Via GUI:   Go to settings -> about > press on build number 7 times and the developer settings will be enable, go back to settings and press on developer mode and then enable USB DEBUGGING.

82," 9 Email Marketing Tips For Content Marketers Even “agnostics” regarding email marketing can't hash out the following evidence - the average ROI from this promotional practice is close to 3,800%. Measureless opportunities to scale up and relative cheapness, compared to other reaching-out channels, are the two reasons why the email marketing is fair-haired by businesses. However, this is not about the price and physical extent alone.  The chief advantage is a better alignment of communication with customers. If you hope a certain content strategy brings desirable results, overlooking the quality of mailing messages will be a sorry pitfall. Always keep in mind that newsletters, welcome, retention, and other emails are not just a brand's facade - but a powerful tool for generating conversions. By joining sides of email and content strategies, you can come up with synergy from both. In this guide, we’ll cover a few recommendations for content marketers on how to write email messages that work.  Tips for email marketing  Segment your list Split the batch of email recipients into smaller groups based on chosen criteria, and mail distinct relevant messages - for each. You can use recipients' GEO, demographic characteristics, or purchase history to distinguish homogeneous clusters and proceed with the content planning. Segmentation is the basic premise for personalization, and if you still doubt why bothering about the latter - here are just a few numbers we took from Instapage: 52% of customers claim they do care if the message was tailor-made or not 82% of marketers say that mail personalization increases the open ratio custom emails have 41% more unique clicks than mass-produced ones. To avoid a fragmented approach, use data from CRMs, website analytics tools, and other sources to define segments. Concerning phrasings, a good idea is to create Buyer personas profiles. Thus, you'll be able to choose the appropriate message length and wording. Say, design a newsletter to promote paid subscription for an email validator service. You've decided to distinguish corporate clients based on their company size and determined the following groups: #1 - B2Bs and #2 - sole entrepreneurs. Possible messages for the two: #1. Our ""XXL"" plan is perfect for agencies and enterprises. One can add unlimited users and conduct up to 100,000 checks per month.  #2. With our ""S"" you get 1,000 credits and 5,000 unique recipients - for only $33 per month. Plus - a 7-days free trial.  Use interactive content The best content marketers know that interactive content came into vogue a long time ago. As to emails, here are the most common examples: CSS animated buttons If you include CTAs buttons (that we hope you do) - liven them up a bit. Add an animated hover effect, so that every time a recipient puts a cursor on a button, it changes shape, shade, color, or text.  “Add hover to emphasise objects”, source  This shouldn’t necessarily be something dramatic - add tiny accents that will yet grab the user's attention. starring  “Add a star rating component to engage readers with content”, source  Including ranking or reviewing widgets in the email body is one of the most working ways to engage the reader with the message. Ask recipients to assess your product or service with stars. Add the link to Google Forms if you want to receive an extended opinion on overall customer satisfaction. pictures' rollovers  “Use animated images to describe goods better”, source  The effect is eagerly used by the ones who promote online stores. Using The rollover allows to show goods from different angles or even play with recipients, if relevant. Take into account that this feature only works on desktops - mobile mail users will see the very first picture only. images carousel  “Add pieces of text directly on images”, source  If you want to enhance goods cards with descriptive content, say - price and shipping details, use a carousel instead of a rollover. As so, you can add more info pictures to the email body and, hopefully, convert more recipients into customers. a countdown  “Countdowns work well for limited in time offers”, source  Again, this type of interactive content fits the online shopping niche. Animated clocks amplify urgency and theoretically increase conversions. But it's important to stay extremely careful and not to sound desperate - otherwise, the newsletter will end up in the recipient's ""Spam"".  Improve design The attractiveness of an email is something granted on certain terms, indeed. Not all emails need to be flashy or include expensive designs. However, there are some prevailing common trends in the matter. By following them, you seem to show the recipient that your company is moving in step with the times, and not stuck in the 2000s. Here's the shortlist from the TOP email design trends list that a 99designs provides - as of 2021: magazine-styled  “Make newsletters to look a bit editorial”, source  More and more newsletters tend to look like a centerfold from good old printed media. With a strict following to the ""Less is more"" principle - clear fonts, short phrases, HD-quality images with a few objects on them, and short CTAs. hand-made illustrations  “Unique pictures create a distinct flavour of your brand”, source  Tailored icons or sketchy images - whatever fits your mailing purpose, just make sure it's not too bright, contrast, or overloaded with details. Give preference to clean colors. skeuomorphic objects This is when a design resembles a real object. To see an example - just open a reader App on your smartphone.  “A skeuomorphic bookshelf”, source  HD photographies  “If you operate in the luxury segment, do not skimp on email visuals”, source  These are expensive content, but if you work in fashion or other chick industries - it may be worth the effort. animated content Yeap, we've covered this in a previous tip. single scroll  “Looks especially good on smartphones”, source  Place the entire email content, including buttons, on the endless-looking long frame. Focus on conversions Stay focused on what's your mailing purpose. Don't forget that everybody expects to see a good ROI from email actions at the end of the reporting period. Craft effective CTAs - perceive these not as a sole button with a ""Download now"" text or so, but as an entire sense of a message that you write. To create a captivating CTA copy, adhere to the below advices: include win-win propositions Even though you’re not providing a customer with a discount or cash refund at the moment, your proposition may include a non-monetary incentive. New arrivals, selection of the latest news, free copies, advice from experts - the only rule here is to offer what’ll hold in high esteem. trigger on emotions Don't long-windedly list benefits. Instead, simulate a life situation and show how your product or service can help. use several CTAs throughout the email Email body may be viewed in several scrolls, especially when via small mobile devices’ screens. If you add a call to action at the beginning of the message, a mere number of users will get back to it after finishing reading the content. Thus, you may lose potential conversion. Include several buttons throughout the email body, but don’t sound repeatedly - change calls’ forms and wording.  Encourage readers to reply Driving recipients to reply is challenging yet able to be done. First, choose the proper writing tone. According to an extensive study of emails that didn’t get a response, the most preferable is a 3rd-grade reading level.  “Too elementary or too proficient tone may scare away readers”, source  Of course, you must apply this recommendation with an eye on the recipient. If you mail to a professor or a government agency, a “3rd-grade” rule isn’t applicable. But all else being equal - simplify the lexicon to the level a schoolchild can understand it. Another trick is to sound overall happy. Emails that are enhanced with positive emotions get 10-15% more replies, on average than neutral ones. The best manner is to choose a slightly warm tone. Exaggerated excitement may look weird and even suspicious, especially when reaching out to business partners. And don’t forget about courtesy. A rare person will respond if you address him or her with a hair-raising “To whom it may concern” phrase.  Make it personal Personification shouldn’t be confused with personalization. The second is rather about mailing fitting content from a commercial perspective, while the first term - about addressing the recipient as a one-off personality. Personal emails start with the recipient’s name - and no other way. They include references to the user's interests or past actions. For example, if your tourist agency’s client is interested in island vacations - you shall approach him or her with respective offers. They also shall contain personalized promotions, if any. The best way to expand this approach on hundreds or thousands of recipients is to launch trigger-based email campaigns. Create delivery scenarios for different segments or stages of a sales pipeline. Then prepare a fitting sequence of relevant content - for every single scenario. To give a human face to mailing, one can practice greetings, as well. Birthdays, state holidays, anniversaries, a new status in the loyalty system - there are a lot of examples of what one may congratulate the customer with.  Keep your emails out of spam folders It is better not to launch mailing at all than to use an untrustworthy emails’ database. The risks are much higher than a slew of undelivered messages - from harming a sender's reputation to being banned by mailing systems. So it's better to stay proactive: tidy away broken, misspelled, temporary, or other worrisome emails from the database - either manually or with the help of software collect a valid email address only - through email finders avoid spam-trigger words establish a double opt-in validation set the correct mailing frequency.  Make sure your emails look clean and crisp Newsletters shall afterall bring revenues - whether you want it or not. But in a bid of quantity, don’t lose the overall content integrity and sense: a subject line, pre-header, header, email body, and calls shall be consistent with one another the copy must be of the proper size; although the length depends on many factors, stick to an “ideal” interval - 50 to 125 words if can, don’t attach too many files or links to external websites - mailing filters are suspicious to these adapt the layout to fit smaller screens - nothing looks worse than broken email elements when you open it on mobile.  Wrapping up It doesn't make much difference whether you create mailing content for personal or business purposes - these email marketing tips will serve both. No strains here - the recipient’s interest should be at your forefront. If you can hook him or her with the content by using tricks we've covered, you’ll never fail with enough conversions.",Messaging

It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measures of interestingness.[1]  Based on the concept of strong rules, Rakesh Agrawal, Tomasz Imieliński and Arun Swami[2] introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets. For example, the rule {onions,potatoes}={burger}, {onions,potatoes}={burger} found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger meat. Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as, e.g., promotional pricing or product placements.  In addition to the above example from market basket analysis association rules are employed today in many application areas including Web usage mining, intrusion detection, continuous production, and bioinformatics. In contrast with sequence mining, association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_rule_learning",Science_Analytics

Initial location for all routers was randomly generated in 3-D space. Hinged upon initially generated locations, distance amidst them is computed using Euclidian formula which serves as Fitness function. Initial Population was selected using Roulette wheel selection using aforementioned Fitness function. Then Crossover was computed if, Probability of crossover. Pc > (Randomly generated probability) using two-point crossover. After this initial population was updated and mutation was done if Pm > (Randomly generated probability). Best chromosome was computed using max fitness function and Inversion / Swapping / Sliding was done on 2nd,3rd,4th chromosome, while 1st chromosome was passed as such using Elite Selection method to preserve best chromosome (Solution in this case). User have laxity to enter number of initial routers, size of initial population and number of iterations for Genetic algorithm to simulate. This method was named as MGA (Modified Genetic Algorithm) and it’s performance was juxtaposed with SGA (Simple Genetic Algorithm) where Initial Selection / Fitness function / Crossover / Mutation method deployed were computed differently using same set of routers co-ordinates used for SGA.

2,"FatiGO. This is the conventional enrichment test where we compare two lists of genes, usually a group of genes which are significant in a given test that are compared to the rest of the genes in the experiment, although any two groups formed in any way can be tested against each other. This approach detects significant over-representation of functional annotations in one gene set respect to the other one. The following sections provide a tutorial on how to use this tool:  Input data Steps Interpreting the output results Worked examples and exercises Citing Input data The input for the Single Enrichment Analysis is a list of genes, transcripts or proteins. If you have a ranked list of the whole genome or proteome, we recommend you to use Gene Set Enrichment.  Steps Online examples. Here you can load small datasets from our server. You can use them to run examples and see how the tool works. Click on the links to load the data. Example1: motor vs apoptosis. The two lists contain genes associated to motor and apoptosis processes. With this analysis we can compare the terms enriched in each list and see that the significant terms are clearly associated to their appropriate list.  Define your comparison. Input data should be a raw counts matrix upload as the data type ID list. See data types [here](Data Types).  Single Enrichment offers two modes to define your comparison:  Id List vs Id List: computing functional enrichment analysis between two list of identifiers of interest. Id List vs Rest of genome: computing functional enrichment analysis of a list of identifiers respect against the rest of the genome. Select your data. Here you can select the dataset you want to analyse by single enrichment. You should have uploaded it previously using the Upload or directly from Select your data. Your data should be tagged as idlist data type. In case the Id List vs Id List has been chosen, the two lists must be selected using Select your data and List 2 boxes. When the second list is the rest of the genome or the complementary list of your annotations, Single Enrichment will calculate the second list and the user must supply only the first one.  Options. Choose options about Fisher test and removing duplicates. Fisher exact test  The user can choose between the three options for the Fisher exact test:  Two-tailed: detects over and under-represented terms comparing both lists Over-represented terms in list 1 (recommended in genome comparison): detects over-represented terms in list 1 of genes. The best choice when list 2 of genes is the rest of the genome. Over-represented terms in list 2: detects over-represented terms in list 2 of genes compared to list 1 of genes. Remove duplicates  GO Enrichment gives the possibility of checking and removing duplicates existence in the lists of gene or protein identifiers. Four options are given:  Never: list 1 and 2 are not checked for duplicate occurrences. Use this option only if you are sure that none of the references are duplicated. Remove on each list separately: each list is preprocessed for duplicates separately. One member of the duplicate pair is kept. Remove on each list and common ids: firstly each list is preprocessed for duplicates separately and one member of the duplicate pair is kept. Then both list are preprocessed for duplicates together and none of the pair is kept. Remove from list 2 those appearing in list 1 (complementary list). Databases. Select the databases which include the annotations that you are interested in. Organism: select in a wide range of species your organism of interest.  Databases included in Babelomics: databases (DB) available for the organism selected can be tested simultaneously and a specific filter option is provided for each one:  GO - biological process:  Options Form:  Filter terms by number of annotated ids in DB: Introduce a minimum and maximum number of annotated ids in the gene set to filter out smaller and bigger terms.  Propagation of functional annotation: You can change if you want propagated GOs or not in the options form. By default propagated is selected.  GO - molecular function. You can define a filter with the same parameters as described above in GO -biological process section.  GO - cellular component. You can define a filter with the same parameters as described above in GO -biological process section.  GOSlim GOA. You can define a filter with the same parameters as described above in GO -biological process section.  Interpro motifs. You can define a filter with the same parameters as described above in GOSlim GOA section.  Genome-Scale Metabolic Network (Recon): you can define a filter with the same parameters as described above in GOSlim GOA section.  Your annotations. This is an useful option for users working on species that our database does not support or that want to use their own annotation. Job information. Fill the information of this job. Give a name to the job and tell the folder where the resulting files should be saved. Select the output folder Choose a job name Specify a description for the job if desired. Launch job. Press Launch job button and wait until the analysis is finished. See the state of your job by clicking the jobs button on the top right at the panel menu. A box will appear at the right side listing all your jobs. When the analysis is finished, it will be labelled as ""Ready"". Then, click on it and you will be redirected to the results page. A normal job may last approximately less than two minutes but the time may vary depending on the size of the list (number of genes/transcripts/proteins). Interpreting the output results The FatiGO method (Al-Shahrour et al., 2004) was the first proposal for functional enrichment that took into account the multiple testing problem. Single Enrichment works as follows:  Single Enrichment compares two lists of genes, usually a group of genes which are significant in a given test that are compared to the rest of the genes in the experiment, although any two groups formed in any way can be tested against each other. These gene lists are transformed to two lists of annotations using the corresponding gene-annotation association table. Then a Fisher's exact test for 2×2 contingency tables is used to check for significant over-representation of functional terms in one of the lists with respect to the other one. Multiple testing correction to account for the multiple hypothesis tested (one for each functional term) is applied. Single Enrichment uses the FDR B&H method. The results page contains the following sections:  Job information. A short description of your analysis.  Input data. In this section you will find a reminder of the parameters or settings you have used to run the analysis. Also the two lists analysed can be downloaded as a text file, even when the genome or your annotations comparison have been chosen.  Duplicates management  Number of duplicates: number of duplicates and percentage. Number of finally used ids: number of finally used ids after removing duplicate identifiers. Summary. A three-column table showing the number of genes annotated to each database in each list. This table can be downloaded as a text file. Id annotations per DB:  DB: the name of the database chosen. Only the databases with at least one gene annotated in one of the lists will be analysed by GO Enrichment. List1: showing three elements. The number of genes in List1 annotated in the database over total number of genes remaining in List1 after the duplicates management. A percentage of genes in List1 annotated in the database. The ratio of annotations per identifier. List2/Genome/Your annotations: the same structure than the List1 explained above but applied to the List2, Genome or Your Annotations after the duplicates management. Significant results Number of significant terms per DB  A three-column table showing the number of significant terms encountered after the functional analysis.  DB: the name of the database analysed. Only the databases with at least one gene annotated in one of the lists are analysed by Single Enrichment. Total number of significant terms: number of significant terms highlighted in red if the test had positive results. Table of significant terms per DB  In this section you will find, in case that a database has significant terms (depending on the p-value selected) a downloadable text file and a table both containing information about the significant terms, and a representation of the DAG in GO databases (GO network section). The table originally sorted by the adjusted p-value can be sorted up and down by clicking in the column headings. In the bottom of the table the user can move within the various pages which the table has been broken down.  Term: description and id of the term. Term size: number of identifiers in the input data annotated to this term. Term size (in genome): global size of the term in the whole genome. Term annotation % per list: percentage of identifiers in each list annotated to the term respect to the total number of identifiers. The percentage is represented as a darker color bar (red List1 and blue List2) meaning highlighting the list with higher percentage and lighter for the list with lower percentage. Annotated ids: list identifiers annotated to this term. By clicking each of the the list of genes can be accessed through a pop-up window where each gene is connected to its accession in Ensembl. Odds ratio (log e): the odds ratio is a way of comparing whether the probability of a certain event is the same for two groups, the sign of it will give us the idea of which of the lists is enriched in this term. When the log e (odds ratio) is positive the List1 is enriched in the term, when the log e (odds ratio) is negative the enrichment is related to List2. p-value: unadjusted p-value from the Fisher's exact test. Adjusted p-value: adjusted p-value from the Fisher's exact test, after correcting for multiple testing, using the FDR procedure of Benjamini & Hochberg. Keep in mind to use this p-value instead of the unadjusted one as GO Enrichment is performing a great number of test simultaneously and the error rate must be corrected. GO network. A representation of the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) in GO databases for the significant GO terms. Colored nodes represent the significant results (red for GOs overrepresented and blue for GOs underrepresented in the list 1), whereas white GOs represent the parents of the significant GOs. Intensity of the color represents smaller adjusted p-value (high statistical significance). You can choose different options to visualize in the tool bar of the embedded application. For further information about how to use Network Viewer Maps, visit the Network viewer documentation.  All results. A downloadable individual text file for each database provides results for all terms, the file has the same structure than the significant results one. Term: identifier of the term. Term size: number of identifiers in the input data annotated to this term. Term size (in genome): global size of the term in the whole genome. List1 positives: number of identifiers of List1 annotated to the functional term. List1 negatives: number of identifiers of List1 not annotated to the functional term. List1 percentage: percentage of identifiers of List1 annotated to the functional term. List2 positives: number of identifiers of List2 annotated to the functional term. List2 negatives: number of identifiers of List2 not annotated to the functional term. List2 percentage: percentage of identifiers of List2 annotated to the functional term. List1 positive ids: list of identifiers in List1 annotated to this term. List2 positive ids: list of identifiers in List2 annotated to this term. Odds ratio (log e): the odds ratio is a way of comparing whether the probability of a certain event is the same for two groups, the sign of it will give us the idea of which of the lists is enriched in this term. When the log e (odds ratio) is positive the List1 is enriched in the term, when the log e (odds ratio) is negative the enrichment is related to List2. p-value: unadjusted p-value from the Fisher's exact test. Adjusted p-value: adjusted p-value from the Fisher's exact test, after correcting for multiple testing, using the FDR procedure of Benjamini & Hochberg. Keep in mind to use this p-value instead of the unadjusted one as GO Enrichment is performing a great number of test simultaneously and the error rate must be corrected. Annotation files. A list of downloadable files containing the identifier - functional term correspondence. If a gene is annotated to several labels, each of the annotations is listed in a separate line. These lists can be used as an input annotation file in the Single Enrichment Your Annotations mode.  Other actions  Change p-value: the p-value used to determine when a functional term is significant or not is highlighted and can be modified to make it more astringent or liberal. The default p-value is 0.05 but the user can change it and Single Enrichment will show the significant results according to the new p-value. Worked examples and exercises How the functional profiling should never be done  It is not uncommon to find the following assertion in papers and talks: ""then we examined our set of genes selected in this way (whatever) and we discover that 65% of them were related to metabolism, so we can conclude that our experiment activates metabolism genes"". This could be true or not depending on the relative abundance of this term. If you look to the rest of genes not activated in the experiment and the proportion of them related to metabolism is, let's say 10%, then you are right. Contrarily, if the proportion is, let's say 61%, then the experiment has probably nothing to do with metabolism. The statistical comparison is compulsory to support such assertions.  Comparing two lists of genes  There are many situations in which the comparison of two lists of genes answers a relevant biological question. Actually a large number of problems can be addressed in this way. For example, one might be interested in knowing whether a group of genes that co-express are functionally related. Typically this implies the comparison of a set of genes that clustered together (by any clustering method) to the rest of genes. Other commonly addressed question is if genes differentially expressed when comparing two experimental conditions are functionally related. And many other similar questions are commonly asked when analysing microarray data or, in general, genomic data. This approach has specifically been designed to answer these kind questions.   ####1. Exploring differences in GO terms with Enrichment Analysis, basics  The simplest use of the tool is to have a quick look at the functional processes where a set of genes take part of. The list of genes submitted is going to be analysed against the rest of the genome to obtain significance of the GO terms or other sets abundance.  Here you can find the corresponding file, for this worked example, containing a list of genes of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. Save this file to your desktop or local directory and upload it to Babelomics as an idlist type of data. Create a new project (e.g. worked_example1) and start a new Enrichment Analysis job in the Functional analysis >> Single enrichment analysis section of the tools. Choose the Id List vs. Rest of genome option. Choose as List1 the data you already upload. In the Options section choose Over-represented terms in List1 as we want to compare the functions of our list of genes against de rest of the genome. As we already know our list of genes we are sure that contains no duplicates but is better to make it sure or apply a duplicate management option. Choose the organism database Saccharomyces cerevisiae Database section check the GO - biological process Give a name to the new job (e.g. example1_Enrichment_Analysis) Maintain the rest of the parameters as default Submit the job (press the launch button) The number of significant functional terms is resumed in a table. If you take a look to the significant results you can sort them by the adjusted pvalue.  You will get a resume table with the number of significant GO terms associated to the genes and then a table for each database with information about the test in each of the significant functional terms. The table can be sorted by the different percentage between the genes annotated in this GO term in each list or by the p-value or p-value adjusted.  Submit other jobs playing around with other parameters: Gene Ontology database, other databases, pvalue.   ####2. Exploring differences in other functional information with Enrichment Analysis, basics Identically to the previous worked example, Enrichment Analysis can be used to check more functional information as InterPro or Genome-Scale Metabolic Network terms.  Here you can find the corresponding file, for the second worked example, containing a list of genes of Homo sapiens. Save this file to your desktop or local directory and upload it as an gene - idlist data type. Create a new project (e.g. worked_Example2) and start a new Enrichment Analysis job in the Functional analysis » Single enrichment analysis section of the tools. Choose the Id List vs. Rest of genome option. Choose as List1 the data you already upload. In the Options section choose Over-represented terms in List1 as we want to compare the functions of our list of genes against de rest of the genome. As we already know our list of genes we are sure that contains no duplicates but is better to make it sure or apply a duplicate management option. Choose the organism database Homo sapiens Database section check the GO - biological process, InterPro and Genome-Scale Metabolic Network check box, then click the options link of GO - biological process. Give a name to the new job (e.g. example2_Enrichment_Analysis) Maintain the rest of the parameters as default Submit the job (press the launch button) The number of significant functional terms for each database are resumed in a table. If you take a look to the significant results you can sort them by the adjusted pvalue.  You will get a resume table with the number of significant GO terms associated to the genes and then a table for each database with information about the test in each of the significant functional terms. The table can be sorted by the different percentage between the genes annotated in this GO term in each list or by the p-value or p-value adjusted.  Afterwards, launch more jobs choosing other or more databases at a time and change the options parameters.   ####3. Exploring differences in GO terms with Enrichment Analysis Let us exemplify the application of Enrichment Analysis with a classical example. We use the data from Chu et al. (1998), The Transcriptional Program of Sporulation in Budding Yeast, Science, 282, 699-705 and cluster the genes according to their expression patterns. We choose a cluster of co-expressing genes and check the hypothesis of ""genes of similar function will tend to co-express"".  The files for the third worked example correspond to a cluster of co-expressing genes and the rest of genes in the experiment of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. Save both files to your desktop or local directory and upload it as an gene - idlist data type. Create a new project (e.g. sporulation) and start a new Enrichment Analysis job in the Functional analysis » Single enrichment analysis section of the tools. Choose the Id List vs. Id List option. Choose as List1 the data sporulation_clus42 and as List2 sporulation_all_but_clus42 you already upload. In the Options section choose Over-represented terms in List1 as we want to compare the functions of our cluster of co-expressed genes against de rest of the clusters. As we already know our list of genes we are sure that contains no duplicates but is better to make it sure or apply a duplicate management option. Choose the organism database Saccharomyces cerevisiae Database section check the GO - biological process check box, click the options link. Check also the GO - Cellular Component. Give a name to the new job (e.g. sporulationEnrichment Analysis) Maintain the rest of the parameters as default Submit the job (press the launch button) If we compare it to the rest of genes in the experiment we can see that several terms related with meiosis and chromosome component are significantly overrepresented in the cluster of co-expressing genes. Keep in mind that this test assumes that you do not have any a priori hypothesis on what biological process is operating in this particular cluster of genes.  ####4. Exploring differences in Gene Ontology  Similarly you can explore functional differences using other functional relevant terms such as cellular components or molecular functions. We can use Enrichment Analysis for this purpose.  The files for the fourth worked example correspond to a list of genes related to apoptosis which will be compared to a list of genes extracted from chromosome 19 of Homo sapiens. Save both files to your desktop or local directory and upload it as a gene - idlist data type. Create a new project (e.g. apoptosis) and start a new Enrichment Analysis job in the Functional analysis » Single enrichment analysis section of the tools. Choose the Id List vs. Id List option. Choose as List1 the data fatigo_apoptosis and as List2 fatigo_chr19 that you already uploaded. In the Options section choose Over-represented terms in List1. Choose the option to manage duplicates separately in the two lists. Choose the organism database Homo sapiens Database section check the GO - Biological Process, GO - Cellular Component and GO - Molecular Function. Give a name to the new job (e.g. apoptosis_vs_chr19_Enrichment Analysis) Maintain the rest of the parameters as default Submit the job (press the launch button) Observing the significant results are enriched only in the apoptosis related list. The terms are associated to the cell programmed death as can be seen in the GO terms description.

There are a lot of merchants depend on Neteller as a main payment method for their customers .    How Do Neteller Payment Gateways Work? (1)The cuthstomer places an order on your website by pressing the ""Submit Order"" or equivalent button, or perhaps enters their card details using an automatic phone answering service.    (2) If the order is via Application, the customer's phone browser encrypts the information to be sent between the browser and the merchant's web server through a secure socket layer.     (3)Subsequently, the merchant then forwards the transaction details to their payment gateway like Neteller , through a secure socket layer again.  (4) Afterwards, the payment gateway sends the transaction information to the payment processor used by the merchant's acquiring bank.    (5) Then the payment processor transfers the transaction info to the card association (Visa / Master card).   (6) To get the payment to your Neteller account, you must link a valid credit card with it either Master or Visa.   7) In an intra-transaction from Neteller to Neteller account, it is important that both accounts have valid credit cards for the transaction to go smoothly. Once the buyer makes a payment through Neteller, the amount will be deducted from their credit card balance and the seller will see the value added in their credit card directly.    (8) Protect your account and make sure that the payment goes to your valid credit card on your Neteller accounts. You must enter CVV/CVS number when entering the credit card details as the number is linked to the API created between application and Neteller accounts. Once the link is established then every transaction is going to be checked by matching the number for the transaction to go smoothly.         ( 9 ) After you get the payment to your credit card account, you will have 3 options:  The first is that you can withdraw the funds through ATM.  The second is that you can transfer the funds to your bank account.  The third is that you can deposit the funds into your Neteller account.",Payments

68,"After last few years of slowdown, Real Estate Sector is set on the path of growth. Though the foreign investment started to flow with the formation of a stable government in May 2014, economic reforms and liberal FDI policies have further made the investment process easy. Riding on the hope of “Acche Din”, India saw a huge $2.2 billion (70% raise) foreign investment as per JLL reports. The World Bank predicts India to be the fastest growing economy in coming years with close to 8% GDP growth rate. The graph below gives a comparative analysis of the GDP performance of the world and developing Countries in South Asia.  The future picture of Indian economy is bright and Real Estate sector is emerging as a lucrative investment option. Apart from private sector investments, several government projects like development of Smart Cities, affordable homes for EWS (economically weaker section of society) and housing for all by 2022 offer good potential for investors. The government is also working to enhance infrastructure across the country with number of highway, Metro and Airport projects.  Developing affordable housing in major cities is a big challenge for government, as 10 million people migrate to cities every year and most of them are job seekers. The last decade has witnessed the migration of 91 Million people to cities and only 51 Million houses were made to accommodate them. The government has implemented several changes in the economy and FDI policy to tackle the issue. The time is right for investors to carry out some intelligent investments and below areten reasons to believe and participate in the growth of the Real Estate in India in 2016.  1. Special Treatment for NRIs on Investment and non-consideration of property leasing as real estate business will boost the foreign investment in Real Estate Sector.  2. The minimum requirements of 20,000 square meter development and capital of $5 Million have been removed. This step welcomes small investors and will promote construction and development in Tier II and Tier III cities.  3. The policy of bringing foreign investment within 6 months of the starting of a project has been done away with, leading to more flexibility and ease of business in the country.  4. Lower interest rates, affordable housing schemes, and easy installments will allure middle-class families to buy property, so we will see a rise in the demand of residential property in class B and C cities.  5. Foreign investor can now exit from a project in 3 years or earlier if the project gets completed. The easy exit policy gives flexibility in ease of doing business, saves time and would invite more FDI.  6. The growing IT and Service industry will need more workforce and office space increasing the demand for residential and commercial property.  7. The soaring E-commerce industry will continue to grow as the number of online shoppers is increasing rapidly, there will be more demand of warehouses in future.  8. Manufacturers with foreign investments are now allowed to directly sell their products using online or offline platforms without government approval. For this, they will need infrastructure, warehouse, and office space, leading to increased real estate requirement.  9. Flexibility to Single brand retail trading in E-commerce will again contribute to the success of Real Estate industry.  10. No government approval is needed for eligible investment in LLP (Limited Liability Partnership) and foreign investment through share Swap. This will enhance the ease of doing business,thus attracting more foreign investors. Keeping in mind the World Bank report and recent economic reforms, Real estate Sector in India holds a huge potential as a long term investment portfolio for individual investors. Besides, metro cities the Tier II and II cities are going to witness exponential growth rate in real estate in 2016. In short, Indian Real Estate business is going to undergo a policy and investment transformation in the coming years. The situation will be more favorable if the land acquisition and other land reform bills get approved in the parliament.",Travel_Transportation

Usually, this is done by companies who want their employees to stay productive and at the same time, engaged to the devices they so love to use. MDM Solutions is the best and most innovative thing happening to the industry right now. It takes the concept of working with “familiarity” and takes it to a whole new level. Mobile Device Management allows large organizations and companies to control the activities of their employees in a way that does not hinder their professional work commitment to their respective companies and organizations. Companies can execute an update in order to bring the MDM software to their employees. This works on mobile phones, smartphones, tablet computers, ruggedized mobile computers, mobile printers, etc. although, the up and coming market industry is keeping up with the latest trends and is upgrading already to laptops and desktops which also support Mobile Device Management. This change is necessary since the restriction demands vary from client to employee. Once joined into the company enterprise MDM service, the data and other paraphernalia in the employee’s personal device is protected and controlled. In this way, coordinating multiple devices with similar settings can help to protect the company and also manage the information sent over the server. It also helps to reduce costs in a variety of ways by making it work efficient.  Technological advancement is even now being conducted with the help of MDM Solutions. The main component of this technology, which consists of industry quality Mobile Device Management software, enables the clients and their companies to develop Over the Air (OTA) Programming. The Over the Air programming allows clients or companies to configure and control a single mobile device, or a large number of mobile devices, or any such device defined by the Mobile Device Management software. It can also be used to send software and OS updates. At the same time, in case of loss of mobile device or other MDM defined devices, clients and companies can remotely lock the device to prevent misuse. They can also wipe the device, thus protecting the data in it from being taken or stolen. Troubleshooting can also be done with the help of this software. Most of the time, it is possible simply with the help of an Over the Air commands sent as an SMS in binary. This type of message means that the message is in the form of a binary code.",Messaging

A photo upload to slack triggers rekognizer to post in Slack about what the image is or what's recognized. In turn there is an S3 copy of the image which then triggers a lambda function to check the photo against a watchlist bucket. If the photo is matched this queues an MQTT thread to be posted to a thing shadow in AWS IoT which is connected to a Phillips Hue Controller managing a Hue Go light. It turns the light from Green to Red signaling that the person is on a watchlist.

62,"Problem Statement  A smart city needs smart mobility, and to achieve this objective, the travel should be made convenient through sustainable transport solutions.  Transportation system all  over the world is facing unprecedented challenges in the current scenario of increased population, urbanization and motorization.  Farewell to all difficulties as reinforcement learning along with deep learning can now make it simpler for consumers.  In this paper we have applied reinforcement learning techniques for a self-driving agent in a simplified world to aid it in effectively reaching its destinations in the allotted time. We have first investigated the environment, the agent operates in, by constructing a very basic driving implementation. Once the agent is successful at operating within the environment, we can then identify each possible state the agent can be in when considering such things as traffic lights and oncoming traffic at each intersection. With states identified, we can implement a Q-Learning algorithm for the self-driving agent to guide the agent towards its destination within the allotted time. Finally, we can improve upon the Q-Learning algorithm to find the best configuration of learning and exploration factors to ensure the self-driving agent is reaching its destinations with consistently positive results.  Our aim is also to find optimum values of parameters of the fitting function alpha, gamma and epsilon, so that the agent can work in an optimized way with the most optimum parameter values. Hence, a comparative analysis has also been conducted.    Methodology used    The solution to the smart cab objective is deep reinforcement learning in a simulated environment. The smart cab operates in an ideal, grid-like city (similar to New York City), with roads going in the North-South and East-West directions. Other vehicles will certainly be present on the road, but there will be no pedestrians to be      concerned with. At each intersection there is a traffic light that either allows traffic in the North-South direction or the East-West direction.  We have assumed that the smart cab is assigned a route plan based on the passengers' starting location and destination. The route is split at each intersection into waypoints, and the smart cab, at any instant, is at some intersection in the world. Therefore, the next waypoint to the destination, assuming the destination has not already been reached, is one intersection away in one direction (North, South, East, or West). The smart cab has only an egocentric view of the intersection it is at: It can determine the state of the traffic light for its direction of movement, and whether there is a vehicle at the intersection for each of the oncoming directions. For each action, the smart cab may either stay idle at the intersection, or drive to the next intersection to the left, right, or ahead of it. Finally, each trip has a time to reach the destination which decreases for each action taken (the passengers want to get there quickly). If the allotted time becomes zero before reaching the destination, the trip has failed. The smart cab will receive positive or negative rewards based on the action it has taken. Expectedly, the smart cab will receive a small positive reward when making a good action, and a varying amount of negative reward dependent on the severity of the traffic violation it would have committed. Based on the rewards and penalties the smart cab receives, the self-driving agent implementation should learn an optimal policy for driving on the city roads while obeying traffic rules, avoiding accidents, and reaching passengers' destinations in the allotted time.  Environment: The smartcab operates in an ideal, grid-like city (similar to New York City), with roads going in the North-South  and East-West directions. Other vehicles will certainly be present on the road, but there will be no pedestrians to be concerned with. At each intersection there is a traffic light that either allows traffic in the North-South direction or the East-West direction. U.S. Right-of-Way rules apply:   On a green light, a left turn is permitted if there is no oncoming traffic making a right turn or coming straight through the intersection.  On a red light, a right turn is permitted if no oncoming traffic is approaching from your left through the intersection. To understand how to correctly yield to oncoming traffic when turning left. ",Mapping

You almost never need to update `create-react-app` itself: it’s delegates all the setup to `react-scripts`.  When you run `create-react-app`, it always creates the project with the latest version of `react-scripts` so you’ll get all the new features and improvements in newly created apps automatically.  To update an existing project to a new version of `react-scripts`, [open the changelog](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), find the version you’re currently on (check `package.json` in this folder if you’re not sure), and apply the migration instructions for the newer versions.  In most cases bumping the `react-scripts` version in `package.json` and running `npm install` in this folder should be enough, but it’s good to consult the [changelog](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for potential breaking changes.  We commit to keeping the breaking changes minimal so you can upgrade `react-scripts` painlessly.  ## Sending Feedback  We are always open to [your feedback](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues).  ## Folder Structure  After creation, your project should look like this:  ``` my-app/   README.md   index.html   favicon.ico   node_modules/   package.json   src/     App.css     App.js     index.css     index.js     logo.svg ```  For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:  * `index.html` is the page template; * `favicon.ico` is the icon you see in the browser tab; * `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.  You can delete or rename the other files.  You may create subdirectories inside `src`. For faster rebuilds, only files inside `src` are processed by Webpack.   You need to **put any JS and CSS files inside `src`**, or Webpack won’t see them.  You can, however, create more top-level directories.   They will not be included in the production build so you can use them for things like documentation.  ## Available Scripts  In the project directory, you can run:  ### `npm start`  Runs the app in the development mode.<br> Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.  The page will reload if you make edits.<br> You will also see any lint errors in the console.  ### `npm run build`  Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br> It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.  The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br> Your app is ready to be deployed!  ### `npm run eject`  **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**  If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.  Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.  You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.  ## Displaying Lint Output in the Editor  >Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.2.0` and higher.  Some editors, including Sublime Text, Atom, and Visual Studio Code, provide plugins for ESLint.  They are not required for linting. You should see the linter output right in your terminal as well as the browser console. However, if you prefer the lint results to appear right in your editor, there are some extra steps you can do.  You would need to install an ESLint plugin for your editor first.  >**A note for Atom `linter-eslint` users**  >If you are using the Atom `linter-eslint` plugin, make sure that **Use global ESLint installation** option is checked:  ><img src=""http://i.imgur.com/yVNNHJM.png"" width=""300"">  Then make sure `package.json` of your project ends with this block:  ```js {   // ...   ""eslintConfig"": {     ""extends"": ""./node_modules/react-scripts/config/eslint.js""   } } ```  Projects generated with `react-scripts@0.2.0` and higher should already have it.   If you don’t need ESLint integration with your editor, you can safely delete those three lines from your `package.json`.  Finally, you will need to install some packages *globally*:  ```sh npm install -g eslint babel-eslint eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y eslint-plugin-flowtype ```  We recognize that this is suboptimal, but it is currently required due to the way we hide the ESLint dependency. The ESLint team is already [working on a solution to this](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/3458) so this may become unnecessary in a couple of months.  ## Installing a Dependency  The generated project includes React and ReactDOM as dependencies. It also includes a set of scripts used by Create React App as a development dependency. You may install other dependencies (for example, React Router) with `npm`:  ``` npm install --save <library-name> ```  ## Importing a Component  This project setup supports ES6 modules thanks to Babel.   While you can still use `require()` and `module.exports`, we encourage you to use [`import` and `export`](http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html) instead.  For example:  ### `Button.js`  ```js import React, { Component } from 'react';  class Button extends Component {   render() {     // ...   } }  export default Button; // Don’t forget to use export default! ```  ### `DangerButton.js`   ```js import React, { Component } from 'react'; import Button from './Button'; // Import a component from another file  class DangerButton extends Component {   render() {     return <Button color=""red"" />;   } }  export default DangerButton; ```  Be aware of the [difference between default and named exports](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36795819/react-native-es-6-when-should-i-use-curly-braces-for-import/36796281#36796281). It is a common source of mistakes.  We suggest that you stick to using default imports and exports when a module only exports a single thing (for example, a component). That’s what you get when you use `export default Button` and `import Button from './Button'`.  Named exports are useful for utility modules that export several functions. A module may have at most one default export and as many named exports as you like.  Learn more about ES6 modules:  * [When to use the curly braces?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36795819/react-native-es-6-when-should-i-use-curly-braces-for-import/36796281#36796281) * [Exploring ES6: Modules](http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html) * [Understanding ES6: Modules](https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read#leanpub-auto-encapsulating-code-with-modules)  ## Adding a Stylesheet  This project setup uses [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) for handling all assets. Webpack offers a custom way of “extending” the concept of `import` beyond JavaScript. To express that a JavaScript file depends on a CSS file, you need to **import the CSS from the JavaScript file**:  ### `Button.css`  ```css .Button {   padding: 20px; } ```  ### `Button.js`  ```js import React, { Component } from 'react'; import './Button.css'; // Tell Webpack that Button.js uses these styles  class Button extends Component {   render() {     // You can use them as regular CSS styles     return <div className=""Button"" />;   } } ```  **This is not required for React** but many people find this feature convenient. You can read about the benefits of this approach [here](https://medium.com/seek-ui-engineering/block-element-modifying-your-javascript-components-d7f99fcab52b). However you should be aware that this makes your code less portable to other build tools and environments than Webpack.  In development, expressing dependencies this way allows your styles to be reloaded on the fly as you edit them. In production, all CSS files will be concatenated into a single minified `.css` file in the build output.  If you are concerned about using Webpack-specific semantics, you can put all your CSS right into `src/index.css`. It would still be imported from `src/index.js`, but you could always remove that import if you later migrate to a different build tool.  ## Post-Processing CSS  This project setup minifies your CSS and adds vendor prefixes to it automatically through [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) so you don’t need to worry about it.  For example, this:  ```css .App {   display: flex;   flex-direction: row;   align-items: center; } ```  becomes this:  ```css .App {   display: -webkit-box;   display: -ms-flexbox;   display: flex;   -webkit-box-orient: horizontal;   -webkit-box-direction: normal;       -ms-flex-direction: row;           flex-direction: row;   -webkit-box-align: center;       -ms-flex-align: center;           align-items: center; } ```  There is currently no support for preprocessors such as Less, or for sharing variables across CSS files.  ## Adding Images and Fonts  With Webpack, using static assets like images and fonts works similarly to CSS.  You can **`import` an image right in a JavaScript module**. This tells Webpack to include that image in the bundle. Unlike CSS imports, importing an image or a font gives you a string value. This value is the final image path you can reference in your code.  Here is an example:  ```js import React from 'react'; import logo from './logo.png'; // Tell Webpack this JS file uses this image  console.log(logo); // /logo.84287d09.png  function Header() {   // Import result is the URL of your image   return <img src={logo} alt=""Logo"" />; }  export default function Header; ```  This works in CSS too:  ```css .Logo {   background-image: url(./logo.png); } ```  Webpack finds all relative module references in CSS (they start with `./`) and replaces them with the final paths from the compiled bundle. If you make a typo or accidentally delete an important file, you will see a compilation error, just like when you import a non-existent JavaScript module. The final filenames in the compiled bundle are generated by Webpack from content hashes. If the file content changes in the future, Webpack will give it a different name in production so you don’t need to worry about long-term caching of assets.  Please be advised that this is also a custom feature of Webpack.  **It is not required for React** but many people enjoy it (and React Native uses a similar mechanism for images). However it may not be portable to some other environments, such as Node.js and Browserify. If you prefer to reference static assets in a more traditional way outside the module system, please let us know [in this issue](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/28), and we will consider support for this.  ## Adding Bootstrap  You don’t have to use [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io) together with React but it is a popular library for integrating Bootstrap with React apps. If you need it, you can integrate it with Create React App by following these steps:  Install React Bootstrap and Bootstrap from NPM. React Bootstrap does not include Bootstrap CSS so this needs to be installed as well:  ``` npm install react-bootstrap --save npm install bootstrap@3 --save ```  Import Bootstrap CSS and optionally Bootstrap theme CSS in the ```src/index.js``` file:  ```js import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css'; import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap-theme.css'; ```  Import required React Bootstrap components within ```src/App.js``` file or your custom component files:  ```js import { Navbar, Jumbotron, Button } from 'react-bootstrap'; ```  Now you are ready to use the imported React Bootstrap components within your component hierarchy defined in the render method. Here is an example [`App.js`](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/gaearon/85d8c067f6af1e56277c82d19fd4da7b/raw/6158dd991b67284e9fc8d70b9d973efe87659d72/App.js) redone using React Bootstrap.  ## Adding Flow  Flow typing is currently [not supported out of the box](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/72) with the default `.flowconfig` generated by Flow. If you run it, you might get errors like this:  ```js node_modules/fbjs/lib/Deferred.js.flow:60  60:     Promise.prototype.done.apply(this._promise, arguments);                            ^^^^ property `done`. Property not found in 495: declare class Promise<+R> {      ^ Promise. See lib: /private/tmp/flow/flowlib_34952d31/core.js:495  node_modules/fbjs/lib/shallowEqual.js.flow:29  29:     return x !== 0 || 1 / (x: $FlowIssue) === 1 / (y: $FlowIssue);                                    ^^^^^^^^^^ identifier `$FlowIssue`. Could not resolve name  src/App.js:3   3: import logo from './logo.svg';                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^ ./logo.svg. Required module not found  src/App.js:4   4: import './App.css';             ^^^^^^^^^^^ ./App.css. Required module not found  src/index.js:5   5: import './index.css';             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ./index.css. Required module not found ```  To fix this, change your `.flowconfig` to look like this:  ```ini [libs] ./node_modules/fbjs/flow/lib  [options] esproposal.class_static_fields=enable esproposal.class_instance_fields=enable  module.name_mapper='^\(.*\)\.css$' -> 'react-scripts/config/flow/css' module.name_mapper='^\(.*\)\.\(jpg\|png\|gif\|eot\|otf\|webp\|svg\|ttf\|woff\|woff2\|mp4\|webm\)$' -> 'react-scripts/config/flow/file'  suppress_type=$FlowIssue suppress_type=$FlowFixMe ```  Re-run flow, and you shouldn’t get any extra issues.  If you later `eject`, you’ll need to replace `react-scripts` references with the `<PROJECT_ROOT>` placeholder, for example:  ```ini module.name_mapper='^\(.*\)\.css$' -> '<PROJECT_ROOT>/config/flow/css' module.name_mapper='^\(.*\)\.\(jpg\|png\|gif\|eot\|otf\|webp\|svg\|ttf\|woff\|woff2\|mp4\|webm\)$' -> '<PROJECT_ROOT>/config/flow/file' ```  We will consider integrating more tightly with Flow in the future so that you don’t have to do this.  ## Adding Custom Environment Variables  >Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.2.3` and higher.  Your project can consume variables declared in your environment as if they were declared locally in your JS files. By default you will have `NODE_ENV` defined for you, and any other environment variables starting with `REACT_APP_`. These environment variables will be defined for you on `process.env`. For example, having an environment variable named `REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE` will be exposed in your JS as `process.env.REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE`, in addition to `process.env.NODE_ENV`.  These environment variables can be useful for displaying information conditionally based on where the project is deployed or consuming sensitive data that lives outside of version control.  First, you need to have environment variables defined, which can vary between OSes. For example, let's say you wanted to consume a secret defined in the environment inside a `<form>`:  ```jsx render() {   return (     <div>       <small>You are running this application in <b>{process.env.NODE_ENV}</b> mode.</small>       <form>         <input type=""hidden"" defaultValue={process.env.REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE} />       </form>     </div>   ); } ```  The above form is looking for a variable called `REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE` from the environment. In order to consume this value, we need to have it defined in the environment:  ### Windows (cmd.exe)  ```cmd set REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE=abcdef&&npm start ```  (Note: the lack of whitespace is intentional.)  ### Linux, OS X (Bash)  ```bash REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE=abcdef npm start ```  > Note: Defining environment variables in this manner is temporary for the life of the shell session. Setting permanent environment variables is outside the scope of these docs.  With our environment variable defined, we start the app and consume the values. Remember that the `NODE_ENV` variable will be set for you automatically. When you load the app in the browser and inspect the `<input>`, you will see its value set to `abcdef`, and the bold text will show the environment provided when using `npm start`:  ```html <div>   <small>You are running this application in <b>development</b> mode.</small>   <form>     <input type=""hidden"" value=""abcdef"" />   </form> </div> ```  Having access to the `NODE_ENV` is also useful for performing actions conditionally:  ```js if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {   analytics.disable(); } ```  ## Integrating with a Node Backend  Check out [this tutorial](https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/using-create-react-app-with-a-server/) for instructions on integrating an app with a Node backend running on another port, and using `fetch()` to access it. You can find the companion GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/fullstackreact/food-lookup-demo).  ## Proxying API Requests in Development  >Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.2.3` and higher.  People often serve the front-end React app from the same host and port as their backend implementation.   For example, a production setup might look like this after the app is deployed:  ``` /             - static server returns index.html with React app /todos        - static server returns index.html with React app /api/todos    - server handles any /api/* requests using the backend implementation ```  Such setup is **not** required. However, if you **do** have a setup like this, it is convenient to write requests like `fetch('/api/todos')` without worrying about redirecting them to another host or port during development.  To tell the development server to proxy any unknown requests to your API server in development, add a `proxy` field to your `package.json`, for example:  ```js   ""proxy"": ""http://localhost:4000"", ```  This way, when you `fetch('/api/todos')` in development, the development server will recognize that it’s not a static asset, and will proxy your request to `http://localhost:4000/api/todos` as a fallback.  Conveniently, this avoids [CORS issues](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21854516/understanding-ajax-cors-and-security-considerations) and error messages like this in development:  ``` Fetch API cannot load http://localhost:4000/api/todos. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost:3000' is therefore not allowed access. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled. ```  Keep in mind that `proxy` only has effect in development (with `npm start`), and it is up to you to ensure that URLs like `/api/todos` point to the right thing in production. You don’t have to use the `/api` prefix. Any unrecognized request will be redirected to the specified `proxy`.  Currently the `proxy` option only handles HTTP requests, and it won’t proxy WebSocket connections.   If the `proxy` option is **not** flexible enough for you, alternatively you can:  * Enable CORS on your server ([here’s how to do it for Express](http://enable-cors.org/server_expressjs.html)). * Use [environment variables](#adding-custom-environment-variables) to inject the right server host and port into your app.  ## Deployment  By default, Create React App produces a build assuming your app is hosted at the server root.   To override this, specify the `homepage` in your `package.json`, for example:  ```js   ""homepage"": ""http://mywebsite.com/relativepath"", ```  This will let Create React App correctly infer the root path to use in the generated HTML file.  ### Now  See [this example](https://github.com/xkawi/create-react-app-now) for a zero-configuration single-command deployment with [now](https://zeit.co/now).  ### Heroku  Use the [Heroku Buildpack for Create React App](https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack).   You can find instructions in [Deploying React with Zero Configuration](https://blog.heroku.com/deploying-react-with-zero-configuration).  ### Surge  Install the Surge CLI if you haven't already by running `npm install -g surge`. Run the `surge` command and log in you or create a new account. You just need to specify the *build* folder and your custom domain, and you are done.  ```sh               email: email@domain.com            password: ********        project path: /path/to/project/build                size: 7 files, 1.8 MB              domain: create-react-app.surge.sh              upload: [====================] 100%, eta: 0.0s    propagate on CDN: [====================] 100%                plan: Free               users: email@domain.com          IP Address: X.X.X.X      Success! Project is published and running at create-react-app.surge.sh ```  Note that in order to support routers that use html5 `pushState` API, you may want to rename the `index.html` in your build folder to `200.html` before deploying to Surge. This [ensures that every URL falls back to that file](https://surge.sh/help/adding-a-200-page-for-client-side-routing).  ### GitHub Pages  >Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.2.0` and higher.  Open your `package.json` and add a `homepage` field:  ```js   ""homepage"": ""http://myusername.github.io/my-app"", ```  **The above step is important!**   Create React App uses the `homepage` field to determine the root URL in the built HTML file.  Now, whenever you run `npm run build`, you will see a cheat sheet with a sequence of commands to deploy to GitHub pages:  ```sh git commit -am ""Save local changes"" git checkout -B gh-pages git add -f build git commit -am ""Rebuild website"" git filter-branch -f --prune-empty --subdirectory-filter build git push -f origin gh-pages git checkout - ```  You may copy and paste them, or put them into a custom shell script. You may also customize them for another hosting provider.  Note that GitHub Pages doesn't support routers that use the HTML5 `pushState` history API under the hood (for example, React Router using `browserHistory`). This is because when there is a fresh page load for a url like `http://user.github.io/todomvc/todos/42`, where `/todos/42` is a frontend route, the GitHub Pages server returns 404 because it knows nothing of `/todos/42`. If you want to add a router to a project hosted on GitHub Pages, here are a couple of solutions: * You could switch from using HTML5 history API to routing with hashes. If you use React Router, you can switch to `hashHistory` for this effect, but the URL will be longer and more verbose (for example, `http://user.github.io/todomvc/#/todos/42?_k=yknaj`). [Read more](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router/blob/master/docs/guides/Histories.md#histories) about different history implementations in React Router. * Alternatively, you can use a trick to teach GitHub Pages to handle 404 by redirecting to your `index.html` page with a special redirect parameter. You would need to add a `404.html` file with the redirection code to the `build` folder before deploying your project, and you’ll need to add code handling the redirect parameter to `index.html`. You can find a detailed explanation of this technique [in this guide](https://github.com/rafrex/spa-github-pages).  ## Something Missing?

310,"Instagram is emerging as the favourite social media platform not only amongst the youth but also amongst small scale businesses. The audience have shifted their preference from facebook to instagram very swiftly. With instagram introducing new features such as stories, IGTV, preferences, highlights, it is winning hearts all over. Apart from being just a photo and video sharing app, Instagram is also emerging as a platform mostly for small scale businesses, graphic designers and influencers. Individuals or firms can use Instagram as a platform to sell their products or even showcase their talents and transform themselves into a well established brand. While on your path of establishing yourself as brand there can be multiple barriers causing delays on your success stories. One of the most frustrating challenge people come across on Instagram is gaining a huge number of followers. You can’t just gain a few million followers overnight unless you are Cristiano Ronaldo or Kim Kardashian.  A normal person will obviously struggle to gain more followers as compared to the celebrities out there. Gaining followers is directly proportional not only to your popularity but also to the quality of the content you upload. People out there are still following the “Go with the trend” policy to keep up with the current market standards. Imagine the same meme appearing on your feed several times. After a point you are going to get irritated and you won’t even be interested in knowing which are the pages that have posted the meme or who is the artist designing the meme. But at the same time if you come across a really unique content that just stands out from the crowd, it has a better chance of being noticed, being appreciated, being shared and ultimately getting a like and a follow back. This is where your creativity and uniqueness plays an important role in gaining likes and followers.Another mistake Instagrammers commit is random posting of photos or videos which has no correlation to the post preceding it or succeeding it. It becomes very important to carefully plan the next set of posts. Planning the upcoming set of posts and uploading them accordingly will make your profile look neat, clean and organised. Since Instagram works on the “rule of 3” you can play around the instagram aesthetics and design your profile in a more effective way. Check out these instagram profiles to understand how you can play with the Instagram aesthetics. (https://www.instagram.com/loudmob.media/ )     Apart from working hard on the quality of content and designing your profile, there is another practice that will help you gain real and genuine followers. The explore tab on instagram does more than showing photos and videos based on the accounts or content you like and follow. Now this practice requires a lot of patience and hard work but again you won’t gain a few million followers overnight unless you are Cristiano Ronaldo or Kim Kardashian. This method is similar to the one you use for making friends in real life. You go to a place you like, see a few people there. The next thing you do is you walk up to them and start a conversation. This is how you make friends. You have to follow exactly the same process but this time on Instagram. Click on the explore tab on Instagram and type the name of the place for example ‘Pune’ then click on places. It will show you all the pictures taken at the venue. Simply like the images and drop a relevant comment on the pictures. Make sure that the comments you drop on these pictures are relevant to what the person actually wants to tell through this picture. For example if you see someone having a meal at a restaurant which you know, you can drop a comment saying “The food is nice here” or “Nice place to hangout” By performing this practice, the chances of that person reverting and coming on to your profile really goes up and. You can start with liking and commenting on 10 pictures a day in your free time and gradually increase the number of photos you like and comment on. This process will surely take a lot of time for you to gain enough followers but again nothing comes easy. Apart from this, you can obviously use relevant and lots of hash tags and by lots we mean not more than 30 hash tags on your photos, tag relevant accounts with superior following and this will bring back likes and followers to your account.    A platform like Instagram can work wonders for small scale businesses, graphic designers or influencers only if one makes the optimum use of this great free to access social media platform. Remember, good things take time to occur. Sometimes a few hours, a few days, a few months or maybe even a few years. Do not ever lose patience and quit midway. You never know you can become the next big thing in this online world. Thank you!Om Pandya ",Photos_Images

6,"A local bank intends to install a new automated teller machine (ATM) to allow users (i.e. bank customers) to perform basic financial transactions.  Each user can have only one account at the bank.  ATM users should be able to view their account balance, withdraw cash (i.e. take money out of their account), and deposit funds (i.e. place money into an account).  The user interface of the ATM contains the following components:  a screen that displays messages to the user a keypad that receives numeric input from the user a cash dispenser that dispenses cash to the user a deposit slot that receives deposit envelopes from the user The cash dispenser begins each day loaded with 500 $20 bills.  The bank wants you to to develop software to perform the financial transactions initiated by bank customers through the ATM.  The bank will integrate the software with the ATM's hardware at a later date.  The software should encapsulate the functionality of the hardware devices (e.g. cash dispenser, deposit slot) within software components, but it doesn't need to be concerned with how these devices actually work.  The ATM hardware has not yet been developed, so instead of writing your program to run on the ATM, you will develop a first version of the software that will run on a PC.  This version should use the monitor to simulate the ATM's screen, and the computer's keyboard to simulate the ATM's keypad.  An ATM session consists of authenticating a user (i.e. proving the user's identity) based on an account number and personal identification number (PIN), followed by creating and executing financial transactions.  To authenticate a user and perform transactions, the ATM must interact with the bank's account information database.  For each bank account, the database stores an account number, a PIN, and a balance indicating the amount of money in the account.  We will assume that the bank only plans to build one ATM, so don't worry about multiple ATM's accessing the database at the same time.  Yes, we're oversimplifying what the ""real world"" experience would be like, because we don't have time to build a full application such as would be needed.    Upon first approaching the ATM (assuming no one is currently using it), the user should experience the following sequence of events:  The screen displays a welcome message and prompts the user to enter an account number The user enters a five digit account number using the keypad The screen prompts the user to enter the PIN associated with the account The user enters a five digit PIN using the keypad If the user enters a valid account number and the correct PIN for that account, the screen displays the main menu If the user enters an invalid account number or PIN, the screen displays an appropriate message and returns to step 1 to restart the authentication process After the ATM authenticates the user, the main menu should contain a numbered option for each of the three types of transactions: balance inquiry (option 1), withdrawal (option 2), and deposit (option 3).  The main menu should also contain an option for the user to exit the system (option 4).  The user then chooses either to perform a transaction (by entering 1, 2, or 3) or to exit the system (by entering 4).  If the user enters 1 to make a balance inquiry, the screen displays the user's account balance.  To do so, the ATM must retrieve the balance from the bank's database.  The following steps describe the actions that occur when the user enters 2 to withdraw money:  The screen displays a menu containing standard withdraw amounts: $20 (option 1), $40 (option 2), $60 (option 3), $100 (option 4), and $200 (option 5).  The menu also contains an option to allow the user to cancel the transaction (option 6) The user enters a menu selection using the keypad If the withdraw amount selected is greater than the user's account balance, the screen displays a message stating this and telling the user to choose a smaller amount.  The ATM then returns to step 1. If the withdraw amount is less than or equal to the user's account balance, the ATM proceeds to the next step If the user chooses to cancel the transaction, the ATM displays the main menu and waits for user input If the case dispenser contains enough cash to satisfy the request, the ATM proceeds to the next step, otherwise it displays a message telling the user to choose a smaller amount, and then returns to step 1 The ATM debits the withdraw amount from the user's account in the bank's database The cash dispenser dispenses the selected amount of money to the user The screen displays a message reminding the user to take the money If the user chooses option 3 to make a deposit:  The screen prompts the user to enter a deposit amount or type 0 (zero) to cancel the transaction The user enters a deposit amount or 0 using the keypad (Note:  the keypad does not contain a dollar sign or decimal point, so numbers must be entered as a number of cents, e.g. 125.  The ATM then divides this number by 100 to obtain a number representing a dollar amount, e.g. 125/100 = 1.25 If the user specifies a deposit amount, the ATM proceeds to the next step; if the user chooses to cancel the transaction by entering 0, the ATM displays the main menu and waits for user input The screen displays a message telling the user to insert a deposit envelope into the deposit slot If the deposit slot receives an envelope within two minutes, the ATM credits the deposit amount to the user's account in the bank's database (the money is not immediately available for withdrawal and must be verified by the bank staff, any checks in the envelope must clear, and funds transferred from the check writer's account to the member's account) When either of these events occur, the bank appropriately updates the user's balance stored in its database, which occurs independently of the ATM If the deposit slot does not receive an envelope within two minutes, the screen displays a message that the transaction has been canceled due to inactivity, and the ATM displays the main menu and waits for user input After the system executes a transaction, it should return to the main menu so that the user can perform additional transactions.  If the user chooses to exit the system, the screen should display a thank you message, then display the welcome message for the next user.",Messaging

155,"Angular-Directive-Project Directives range from very basic to extremely complex. This project will build up to some somewhat difficult directives. Keep in mind that the format we're learning for directives is the same format used to build some extremely complex things in angular. Using directives often and well is one way to show you're a talented developer.  Starting Out  We've included only a few things for you to begin with. index.html, app.js, styles.css. At this point the best way to get more comfortable with angular is to initialize an app without relying heavily on boilerplate code (reusable code that starts out your projects for you).  You'll notice that in the index.html we've included the angular-route CDN. Yes, we'll be using angular's router here. Put an ng-view into your index.html.  In your app.js set up a config and set up our first route for when a user is at the '/home' url. If you're having trouble remembering how to set up the router go look at how you set up the router on the previous project. One way these projects will be beneficial to you is allowing you to look back at something *you** did and seeing how you got that something to work.* You may also want add an otherwise that defaults to /home. Create a controller and a template file for this route in your app folder. Don't forget to include the controller as a script in your index.html Check that everything is hooked up correctly. Try adding a div with some text in your home template just to make sure it's showing up. Once you've got that going you're ready to start on some directives. Now let's make our directive. We'll start with a simple one that we can use to display information passed to it.  Step 1. Start your directive  Woot. When you're initializing your directive just remember that it works very similarly to how you start up a controller or a service. It can also be very helpful to think of your directive as a route.  Create your directive. You'll use the directive method on your angular module. It takes two arguments, the name string and the callback function, which will return the object that represents your directive. When naming your directive give it a name with two words; dirDisplay would be nice, but anything works. Just remember it's best practice to give a directive a camel case name so that it's clear in your html what it is. Also we're going to need a template html for our directive. We could do it inline, but let's make another file instead. Just name it something that makes sense for the name of your directive and put it in the same directory as your directive file. For your template just make a <div> and inside a <h1> tag that says User. Now in your home route html add in your directive. It will look like this if you named it dirDisplay: <dir-display></dir-display> Start up your app and go to the home route. Check and make sure you see User where your directive was placed. If you're not seeing it at this point it could mean a few things. Here's some more common issues. You didn't link your directive in your index as a script. Your name for your directive doesn't match the name in your html. Remember camel case becomes snake case so myDirective becomes <my-directive></my-directive>. You're file path to your html template is wrong. You have to think of file paths in angular as relative to the index. Here's some code to see just for this part, and just for the directive's js file.  var app = angular.module('directivePractice'); app.directive('dirDisplay', function(){   return {     templateUrl: 'app/directives/dirDisplay.html'   }; }); What we're returning is the directive object. You won't see anymore code in this tutorial so it's important you get things working right and refer back to what you've already done to advance from now on.  Step 2. Advancing directives  Your directive should be loaded up now, but it's not really doing much. Let's make it better.  In your home controller. Make a variable on your $scope called user. Set it's value to {   name: ""Geoff McMammy"",   age: 43,   email: ""geofdude@gmail.com"" } Now inside your directive's html specifically inside the <h3> tags display our new user's name. Then inside maybe some <h4> tags display his email and age. This is going to work exactly the same as if it was just inside your home controller. Reload the page and make sure it works. This is still very cosmetic and really not all that useful. It needs functionality.  Add into your directive's object the link property. The link property's value is a function definition that takes (generally) three parameters. scope, element, and attributes. Unlike in other places with angular injection these parameter names don't carry meaning. The first parameter will always represent your $scope for that directive, the second will always be the element that wraps your whole directive, and the third will always be an object containing all the properties and values of the attributes on your directive in the dom. Try the following to get a feel for all three.  Add two attributes to your directive in your html. Like this - <dir-display test=""myTest"" my-check=""checkItOut""></dir-display> Now in the link property you've added console.log the three parameters in the function. You'll see an object for scope that should look identical to the $scope of your html function. For element you'll see an object the represents the DOM wrapper for your directive. For attributes you'll see an object that will look like this:  {   test: ""myTest"",   myCheck: ""checkItOut"" } An important thing to notice is how it has again converted snake case to camel case for you. my-check became myCheck. Don't forget this. You'll run into this issue one day. It counts for both attributes and directive names.  To feel some of what the link function could do let's try this.  Add a ng-show to both the email and age wrappers. This should be familiar to you. Now inside your link function add a click event listener to your element property. It's going to look just like jQuery. element.on('click', function(){  }) Inside the click listener's callback add a toggle for the ng-show property you passed in. Along with a console.log to make sure things are connecting when you click. Try it out. Don't call for a mentor when it doesn't work. Let's talk about that first. You should see the console.log firing, but why isn't it toggling. This is going to be a common problem when working with the link function and event listeners. What we have here is an angular digest problem. The value is changing on the scope object, but the change isn't being reflected by our DOM. That's because angular isn't aware of the change yet. Anytime we cause an event to happen using something like jQuery or even angular's jQLite we need to let angular know that we've made a change.  Add this line of code in place of your console.log, scope.$apply(). Now try it out. It should be working now, so if you're still having issues it's time to debug. What we've done is forced angular to run it's digest cycle. This is where angular checks the scope object for changes and then applies those to the DOM. This is another good lesson to learn for later. You'll most likely hit this when making changes to your element using event listeners.  Step 3. Directive's re-usability.  Now our directive has some extremely basic functionality. One of a directive's greatest advantages though is its ability to be placed anywhere and still be functional. Let's say instead we had a list of users instead of just one.  Change the $scope property in your home controller to be users and give it this array as its value: [  {    name: ""Geoff McMammy"",    age: 43,    email: ""geofdude@gmail.com"",    city: ""Provo""  },  {    name: ""Frederick Deeder"",    age: 26,    email: ""fredeed@gmail.com"",    city: ""Austin""  },  {    name: ""Spencer Rentz"",    age: 35,    email: ""spencerrentz@gmail.com"",    city: ""Sacramento""  },  {    name: ""Geddup Ngo"",    age: 43,    email: ""geddupngo@gmail.com"",    city: ""Orlando""  },  {    name: ""Donst Opbie Leevin"",    age: 67,    email: ""gernee@gmail.com"",    city: ""Phoenix""  } ] Now in your home HTML add a ng-repeat to the directive call. Tell it to repeat for each user in users. Reload your page. It's working! But why? How does each directive instance know what information to display?  In the link function console.log the scope parameter. Make sure it's outside of your click listener. You'll see five print outs in your console. Open up any one of them and look to the bottom. Open up the user property. It's exactly what we would want! But again why would that be the case? Don't get too caught up in this next bit if it's too hard to understand, but the ng-repeat is essentially making new tiny scope objects for each individual user in our users array. Now each of our directives is still getting a user property on the scope object just like the directive wanted in the beginning. Woot.  Step 4. Ramp it up with Isolate Scope.  Directives can do so much more. So let's make that happen. That means we should make.... a new directive!!! This directive's purpose will be to display a selected User and the weather in his/her/its location. Link it up just like the last one.  Create a js file for our directive and name it dirWeather. Make an html file named dirWeather.html. Link it up in your index.html and add the template to your new directive object. In your directive's template give it an <h3> tag that says Weather just so we can know it's working. Above your ng-repeat on dirDisplay add your new dirWeather directive. If it's not working check the instructions above as to some common reasons why before asking a mentor for help. If you're seeing the Weather text on your page then we're ready to try out the dreaded Isolate Scope. The isolate scope object is one of the stranger API's in angular. I'm sorry but it is. Just refer to this for now.  scope: {  string: '@',  link: '=',  func: '&' } The properties on the scope object represent the attributes on the directive in the html. Our example scope object here would look something like this in the html. <example-directive string=""a string"" link=""user"" func=""updateUser()""></example-directive> The hard part here is the @, =, and &. They each have very important and distinct meanings.  @ says take in my attribute value as a string. = says take in my attribute value as a two-way bound variable from the parent scope. & says take in my attribute value as a reference to a function on the parent scope. It's also critical to point out that once you add a scope object you have no isolated your directive's scope. Meaning, aside from the values passed in through attributes, this directive has no connection to the $scope of its parent.  That being said let's isolate our directive's scope. :worried:  Add the scope property to your dirWeather. Give it the value of an object with a property of currentUser whose value is '='. Remember in your html this will look like current-user. This is the third time I've said so don't expect it again. This means that whatever comes into the currentUser attribute is going to be a value of the parent's scope object.  For now test this out by passing in users[0]. Find a way to show that users information inside your dirWeather's html. Remember inside your directive now the user is represented by currentUser. Step 5. &? &!?  The '=' value on your scope object has created a two-way binding between users[0] and currentUser. Now let's try out the '&'.  On your home controller add a function called getWeather. It takes one parameter called city. This function will make a call to a service so we'll need to create that. Make a weather service. Name it something cool and creative like weatherService. Inside the weather service make a function called getWeather that also takes one parameter, city. Make an $http get to this url - 'http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=' After the q= add on the city parameter. If you want you can test this out in postman. See what kind of data you get back. If it's the weather of that city then... you win! Use $q to return a promise that only resolves with the data you want. Temperature (preferably not in Kelvin) and the weather description. Use console.log on the data coming from the $http request to get to what you want. You'll need to add both on an object that you resolve your new promise with. On your home controller have it return the result of invoking the get getWeather function on the service. You should be returning a promise. Now in your home route's HTML pass in the getWeather function to the dirWeather directive through an attribute called weather-call. Add the attribute to your isolate scope object. That was a lot of linking, but let's walk through it. Your controller has a function linked to the service, which is in turn linked to your directive. So if you run the weatherCall function in your directive it will go through your controller to your service and then back.  Now things get a little bit tricky. Angular's way of passing along arguments through a directive to your controller are tricky, but once you understand how to do it, it's not hard. I'm going to give an example here of how it works.  <my-directive pass-func=""callFunc(data)""></my-directive> Here's how it would look in your HTML. But where's the data supposed to be coming from? It seems that you'd rather be able to pass in data from your directive. Well you still can, you just have to essentially tell angular what do use as an argument to replace data when it calls that function in your controller. The actualy function call inside the directive will look like this.  $scope.passFunc({data: wantedData}) So what you'll do is pass in an object where the property name is what the argument is named in the HTML where you call the directive. That might sound confusing, but just look at the two code blocks above for a pattern. Note that pass-func becomes $scope.passFunc and data is being replaced with wantedData with the {data: wantedData} object. In our directive we want to replace city in the attribute call, for something else inside the directive. You'll follow the same pattern as above.  For now let's get things set up for that function call.  Add to the dirWeather directive object a property called controller. It's value will be a function. Yes, this is a controller specifically for your one directive. It works the same as any other controller, except you don't give it a name. It's $scope object will only be accessible within an instance of your directive. Don't forget to inject $scope in the function.  Inside your controller function run the weatherCall function with the city property from the currentUser on your $scope. Here's where you need to make sure you've passed in a city argument in the attribute function call, and then replace that with your currentUser's city using an object with a city property. The function call should return a promise, so call .then afterward and add the data onto your $scope to display both the weather and temperature of the currentUser's city. The properties can be named whatever makes sense to you.  You may also want to find a way to get rid of all the decimal places on your temperature. Now you should have everything hooked up so it shows Geoff's data and the weather data for Provo. But is that good enough?  Step 6. Ramping up our ramp up.  Now let's change this so it shows the weather data for whichever user we select. We're going to need to use '&' again.  Make a function on the home controller that takes in a parameter and sets a property on the $scope to be that parameter. Maybe you see where this is going.  We want to get this function into our dirDisplay controller. But in order to do that we need to isolate dirDisplay's scope. This also means we need to pass in each individual user through the scope object as well.  To make it easier on ourselves, let's pass the current user from our ng-repeat into our directive through a user attribute. This way we can leave our two-way bindings as they are. Also pass our new function that sets our current user from our home controller into our directive through a setUser attribute.  You'll need to add an argument in there again. Go with user. Your scope object in dirDisplay should have two properties. setUser with the value of '&' and user with the value of '='. As before we're going to need to do some tricky stuff to get our argument back to our controller.  Call the setUser function inside our click event listener and pass in an object the sets our user argument to be the user on our directive's scope object. If you've forgotten this part go back up and take a look at how you did it before or the example in this README.  Whatever user you click on now should show up in the dirWeather directive as the current user. But we're missing one thing, we want to be able to see the weather for that user too. We'll have to do one more thing that will seem a little bit tricky at first, but it's good to learn if you don't know it already since it's actually used quite frequently.  We need to step up a change listener on our currentUser in the dirWeather directive. We'll use angular's $watch functionality. $watch is a method on your $scope that will watch for changes in a variable you give it. It works in two ways.  $scope.$watch('property', function(value){  console.log(""When $scope.property changes its new value is: "", value) }); And  $scope.$watch(function(){  return myVar }, function(value){  console.log(""When myVar changes its new value is: "", value); }); Remove the immediate function call that we have in there now. Maybe just comment it out for now because we'll use it in a bit. Now call the $watch method on your scope and have it watch currentUser. Either way of using $watch is fine. Have its callback run the $scope.weatherCall function just like you had it before.  One thing to note is that $scope.$watch will always run once to begin with. Since that's what we want here it's great, but just be aware of that.  If you've reached this point congratulate yourself. You've messed with some serious stuff today, namely directives. There are still a lot of things about directives that we can't possibly cover in a single project. If you like what we've done so far then you're in a good place to keep going. A developer who understands directives well can build a really clean looking code base. Just look at your home.html. It could have just two lines in it. If you're feeling good move on now to Step 7.  Step 7. Finishing touches  Try to work out these problems on your own.  There should be a way to let the user know that the weather data is loading. Something that appears while our $http request is retrieving our data. The $http request shouldn't fire on both opening and closing a user's information. A color change for the currently active user would be nicer than showing that user's info inside the dirWeather modal. Or at least less redundant. Whatever else you want. We still haven't explored transclusion and ng-transclude so give that a try if you're feeling adventurous. Just know that it's a way for deciding where to put the HTML child elements of a directive. It's cool stuff that can involve some criss-crossing of scopes.",Weather
