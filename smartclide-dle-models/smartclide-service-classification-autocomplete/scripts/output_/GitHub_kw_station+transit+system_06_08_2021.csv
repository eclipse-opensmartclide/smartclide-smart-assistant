1,TiranaTransit,https://github.com/First-iOS-Steps/TiranaTransit.git,"Tirana transit is a real time  journey planning application for the iOS platform. It is focused precisely on the public transport operating in Tirana. Using the GPS technology and the integrated map features users can see their current location and all the station around them. The location of the stations will be registered by me and it is achieved by providing the coordinates.   Users will be able to get the schedule for specific stations of a line, get the next stops in real time. The app sends notifications for their departures and users can see the connections that the current station offers with different lines. You can see all the stations of a line in the map as well. This will be implemented by using the drawing methods the swift languages provide.  Moreover, there are alerts in case of traffic disruptions. The alert will be line specific and it will pop up as a notification in the users screen.   A full network map image will be provided in order for users to see for themselves the connections and routes.  Users will be able to login and buy their tickets via the app which will avoid having a line of people waiting to buy a ticket from the driver. The ticket implementation will be done via Stripe an online service. The workflow is as follows:    Collecting credit card information from your customer Converting the credit card information to a single-use token Sending this token to your server to create a charge.  The login will be implemented by using parse in order to save the user data. Parse offers an online database storage and it is efficient for projects of this size. A chat may be provided to contact the support for any issues.   There are two courses that I am mainly interested in apart from software engineering. These are namely database and information systems, network security. Both offered in the masters program. I need the database for the user information as I already mention and the system has to be secure when it comes to making payments. I believe they are an integral part when it comes to designing software because you want your product to be as much reliable and efficient as possible. This would allow me to improve my application.",3,1,3,station+transit+system,GitHub

3,SEO,https://github.com/Deepak019/SEO.git," What is GPS? By definition, Global Positioning System (GPS) is a worldwide network formed by a group of 24 satellites that orbit earth and transmit signals to the ground stations. These satellites were put into orbit by the U.S. Department of Defence with the intention to cater military requirements. Later, it was made available for civilian benefit. What is GPS Tracking? GPS Tracking is the technique that helps you locate a vehicle, person or an asset using the Global Positioning System (GPS).  Is GPS Tracking reliable? Immensely. GPS tracking provides you much accurate results knowing the fact that the signals have to travel thousands of kilometres across the space. GPS results may vary within few dozen feet which means that you can pinpoint whether you are at home or in the park across the street. Applications of GPS Tracking Some of the many applications are: 	Company Fleet Management: Assists a company to manage their fleet, cut back on extra costs and improve their efficiency. 	Vehicle Tracking: Keep track of your vehicle. 	Child Tracking: Know the location of your child. 	Elderly people and Special People Tracking: Be with your elders or disabled loved ones in case of emergency. 	Prevention of Theft: A vehicle can be easily recovered knowing its location. There are n number of other uses from finding a friend in the market place to track your laptop while travelling. Try it to discover some more. Now, let’s come on to the most widely used application of GPS – Vehicle Tracking.   Vehicle tracking Vehicle tracking systems keep an eye on the vehicle in real time to get the full picture of all its travelled locations. Variants of Vehicle Tracking System Passive: Simpler in nature, a tracker (GPS device) is installed on the vehicle, which tracks the location of the vehicle over time. When required, the tracker is removed and data is transferred to computer for analysis and report generation. Active: Bit complex, in this variant tracker transmits the data in real time via satellite to the server. Vehicle tracking software used here evaluates the data constantly as received.  Benefits of Vehicle Tracking System Vehicle tracking system uses an integrated vehicle tracking software along with the tracker device to help you achieve the following: 	Surveillance – Follow your vehicle on go. 	Monitoring of fuel – Oversee the fuel consumption. 	Distance Travelled – Distance travelled by vehicle. 	Asset tracking – Closely monitor the valuable asset movements and its operating status. 	Trailer tracking – Load carrying unit of the vehicle is known as “Trailer”. Track them too! 	Transit Tracking – Temporary tracking of cargoes (assets) from one point to another and many more.  A number of vehicles under the single ownership or travelling together are termed as  “fleet”. So, the above benefits would multiply with the number of vehicles (fleet) and would prove to be of great advantage for fleet management companies.  Note: There are various types of vehicle tracking software available in the market and benefits can be enhanced by the choice you make.",1,0,1,station+transit+system,GitHub

13,Bike_sharing_data_analysis,https://github.com/malmusfer/Bike_sharing_data_analysis.git,"# 2019 Metro Bike Share Data Exploration and Visualization  ## Dataset  [Metro Bike Share] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Bike_Share)  is a bicycle sharing system in the Los Angeles, California metropolitan area. The service was launched on July 7, 2016. It is administered by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) and is operated by Bicycle Transit Systems.[ The system uses a fleet of about 1,400 bikes and includes 93 stations in Downtown Los Angeles, Venice, and the Port of Los Angeles. The dataset used for this exploratory analysis consists of [monthly individual trip data](https://bikeshare.metro.net/about/data/) from January 2019 to December 2019 in CSV format.  ##### Data wrangling process: - fix multiple fields that are not in the correct dtype, i.e. `start_time`, `end_time` should be DateTime type, `passholder_type`  should be categorical data type, etc - add new columns for the day of week and month - filter out outlier trip records where the duration was very long   ## Summary of Findings I could define the riders into two groups, Royal customers, (annual, and monthly- pass holders) and regular customers (single-pass holders).   In general, there were more trips on workdays (Mon-Fri) compared to weekends. Summar time was the most popular season of a year, likely due to the weather. The riding trips tend to be shorter on Monday through Friday compared to weekends. It indicates a pretty stable and efficient usage of the bike-sharing system on normal workdays, while more casual flexible use on weekends.  The users who have a monthly pass are the main end-users with the highest trips per year. And more than half of the total trips were done by using a standard type of bikes. Indeed, More than two-third of trips were booked a one-way trip, larger than a round trip.   ## Key Insights for Presentation  Different usage patterns/habits between all types of riders are seen from the exploration. Royal customers, (annual, and monthly- pass holders) use the system heavily on workdays i.e. Monday through Friday whereas customers ride a lot on weekends. The efficient/short period of usage for royal customers corresponds to their high concentration on rush hours Monday through Friday, indicating the use is primarily for the work commute. The more relaxing and flexible pattern of customer use shows that they're taking advantage of the bike-sharing system quite different from the regular customers, heavily over weekends, for city tour or leisure purpose probably.",0,0,0,station+transit+system+bike-sharing+royal-customers+regular-customers+trips,GitHub
