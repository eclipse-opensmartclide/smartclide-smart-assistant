Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.     The bee, of course, flies anyway     because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.     Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.     Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little.     Barry! Breakfast is ready!     Ooming!     Hang on a second.     Hello?     - Barry? - Adam?     - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up.     Looking sharp.     Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.     Sorry. I'm excited.     Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son.     A perfect report card, all B's.     Very proud.     Ma! I got a thing going here.     - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me!     - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye!     Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!     - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry.     - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation.     Never thought I'd make it.     Three days grade school, three days high school.     Those were awkward.     Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive.     You did come back different.     - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.     - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah.     - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going.     Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.     Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead.     I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.     I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.     That's why we don't need vacations.     Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances.     - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are!     - Bee-men. - Amen!     Hallelujah!     Students, faculty, distinguished bees,     please welcome Dean Buzzwell.     Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of...     ...9:15.     That concludes our ceremonies.     And begins your career at Honex Industries!     Will we pick ourjob today?     I heard it's just orientation.     Heads up! Here we go.     Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.     - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary.     Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco     and a part of the Hexagon Group.     This is it!     Wow.     Wow.     We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life     to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.     Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.     Our top-secret formula     is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured     into this soothing sweet syrup     with its distinctive golden glow you know as...     Honey!     - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin!     - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins.     - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive     to improve every aspect of bee existence.     These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.     - What do you think he makes? - Not enough.     Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.     - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey     that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions.     Oan anyone work on the Krelman?     Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know     that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.     But choose carefully     because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.     The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.     What's the difference?     You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off     in 27 million years.     So you'll just work us to death?     We'll sure try.     Wow! That blew my mind!     ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that?     One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make.     I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.     But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?     Why would you question anything? We're bees.     We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.     You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?     Like what? Give me one example.     I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.     Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.     Wait a second. Oheck it out.     - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow.     I've never seen them this close.     They know what it's like outside the hive.     Yeah, but some don't come back.     - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks!     You guys did great!     You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!     - I wonder where they were. - I don't know.     Their day's not planned.     Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.     You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.     Right.     Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.     It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it.     Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.     Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too?     Distant. Distant.     Look at these two.     - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them.     It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.     Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!     He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!     - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out.     What were you doing during this?     Trying to alert the authorities.     I can autograph that.     A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?     Yeah. Gusty.     We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.     - Six miles, huh? - Barry!     A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.     - Maybe I am. - You are not!     We're going 0900 at J-Gate.     What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough?     I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.     Hey, Honex!     Dad, you surprised me.     You decide what you're interested in?     - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one.     Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?     Son, let me tell you about stirring.     You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.     You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing.     You know, Dad, the more I think about it,     maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.     You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?     That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.     Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!     - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny.     You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!     - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me!     Wait till you see the sticks I have.     I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!     Let's open some honey and celebrate!     Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae.     Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!     I'm so proud.     - We're starting work today! - Today's the day.     Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone.     Yeah, right.     Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...     - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left!     One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side.     - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar!     Wow!     Oouple of newbies?     Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!     Make your choice.     - You want to go first? - No, you go.     Oh, my. What's available?     Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.     - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on.     I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.     Wax monkey's always open.     The Krelman opened up again.     What happened?     A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.     Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.     Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!     Oh, this is so hard!     Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,     humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,     mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?     Barry!     All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...     What happened to you? Where are you?     - I'm going out. - Out? Out where?     - Out there. - Oh, no!     I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.     You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?     Another call coming in.     If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd     that gets their roses today.     Hey, guys.     - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?     Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.     It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.     Really? Feeling lucky, are you?     Sign here, here. Just initial that.     - Thank you. - OK.     You got a rain advisory today,     and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain.     So be careful. As always, watch your brooms,     hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.     Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us.     Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!     - That's awful. - And a reminder for you rookies,     bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!     All right, launch positions!     Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!     Black and yellow!     Hello!     You ready for this, hot shot?     Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.     Wind, check.     - Antennae, check. - Nectar pack, check.     - Wings, check. - Stinger, check.     Scared out of my shorts, check.     OK, ladies,     let's move it out!     Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers!     All of you, drain those flowers!     Wow! I'm out!     I can't believe I'm out!     So blue.     I feel so fast and free!     Box kite!     Wow!     Flowers!     This is Blue Leader. We have roses visual.     Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.     Roses!     30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.     Stand to the side, kid. It's got a bit of a kick.     That is one nectar collector!     - Ever see pollination up close? - No, sir.     I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there,     a pinch on that one. See that? It's a little bit of magic.     That's amazing. Why do we do that?     That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.     Oool.     I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow. Oould be daisies. Don't we need those?     Oopy that visual.     Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.     Say again? You're reporting a moving flower?     Affirmative.     That was on the line!     This is the coolest. What is it?     I don't know, but I'm loving this color.     It smells good. Not like a flower, but I like it.     Yeah, fuzzy.     Ohemical-y.     Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby.     My sweet lord of bees!     Oandy-brain, get off there!     Problem!     - Guys! - This could be bad.     Affirmative.     Very close.     Gonna hurt.     Mama's little boy.     You are way out of position, rookie!     Ooming in at you like a missile!     Help me!     I don't think these are flowers.     - Should we tell him? - I think he knows.     What is this?!     Match point!     You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it!     Yowser!     Gross.     There's a bee in the car!     - Do something! - I'm driving!     - Hi, bee. - He's back here!     He's going to sting me!     Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze!     He blinked!     Spray him, Granny!     What are you doing?!     Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable.     I gotta get home.     Oan't fly in rain.     Oan't fly in rain.     Oan't fly in rain.     Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!     Ken, could you close the window please?     Ken, could you close the window please?     Oheck out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure.     You see? Folds out.     Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.     What was that?     Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This...     Drapes!     That is diabolical.     It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.     What's number one? Star Wars?     Nah, I don't go for that...     ...kind of stuff.     No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds.     When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.     There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.     I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it.     I predicted global warming.     I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.     Wait! Stop! Bee!     Stand back. These are winter boots.     Wait!     Don't kill him!     You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me!     Why does his life have less value than yours?     Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement?     I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling.     My brochure!     There you go, little guy.     I'm not scared of him. It's an allergic thing.     Put that on your resume brochure.     My whole face could puff up.     Make it one of your special skills.     Knocking someone out is also a special skill.     Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.     - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.     - You could put carob chips on there. - Bye.     - Supposed to be less calories. - Bye.     I gotta say something.     She saved my life. I gotta say something.     All right, here it goes.     Nah.     What would I say?     I could really get in trouble.     It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human.     I can't believe I'm doing this.     I've got to.     Oh, I can't do it. Oome on!     No. Yes. No.     Do it. I can't.     How should I start it? ""You like jazz?"" No, that's no good.     Here she comes! Speak, you fool!     Hi!     I'm sorry.     - You're talking. - Yes, I know.     You're talking!     I'm so sorry.     No, it's OK. It's fine. I know I'm dreaming.     But I don't recall going to bed.     Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting.     This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee!     I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this,     but they were all trying to kill me.     And if it wasn't for you...     I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised.     That was a little weird.     - I'm talking with a bee. - Yeah.     I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me!     I just want to say I'm grateful. I'll leave now.     - Wait! How did you learn to do that? - What?     The talking thing.     Same way you did, I guess. ""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up.     - That's very funny. - Yeah.     Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with.     Anyway...     Oan I...     ...get you something? - Like what?     I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Ooffee?     I don't want to put you out.     It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.     - It's just coffee. - I hate to impose.     - Don't be ridiculous! - Actually, I would love a cup.     Hey, you want rum cake?     - I shouldn't. - Have some.     - No, I can't. - Oome on!     I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.     - Where? - These stripes don't help.     You look great!     I don't know if you know anything about fashion.     Are you all right?     No.     He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison.     He finally gets there.     He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on.     And he says, ""Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan.     Why would I marry a watermelon?""     Is that a bee joke?     That's the kind of stuff we do.     Yeah, different.     So, what are you gonna do, Barry?     About work? I don't know.     I want to do my part for the hive, but I can't do it the way they want.     I know how you feel.     - You do? - Sure.     My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.     - Really? - My only interest is flowers.     Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan.     Anyway, if you look...     There's my hive right there. See it?     You're in Sheep Meadow!     Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!     No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once.     - Why do girls put rings on their toes? - Why not?     - It's like putting a hat on your knee. - Maybe I'll try that.     - You all right, ma'am? - Oh, yeah. Fine.     Just having two cups of coffee!     Anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee.     Yeah, it's no trouble.     Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life.     Are you...?     Oan I take a piece of this with me?     Sure! Here, have a crumb.     - Thanks! - Yeah.     All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around.     Or not.     OK, Barry.     And thank you so much again... for before.     Oh, that? That was nothing.     Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...     This can't possibly work.     He's all set to go. We may as well try it.     OK, Dave, pull the chute.     - Sounds amazing. - It was amazing!     It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life.     Humans! I can't believe you were with humans!     Giant, scary humans! What were they like?     Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.     They eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy.     - Do they try and kill you, like on TV? - Some of them. But some of them don't.     - How'd you get back? - Poodle.     You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see.     You had your ""experience."" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal.     - Well... - Well?     Well, I met someone.     You did? Was she Bee-ish?     - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you! - No, no, no, not a wasp.     - Spider? - I'm not attracted to spiders.     I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all.     I can't get by that face.     So who is she?     She's... human.     No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law.     - Her name's Vanessa. - Oh, boy.     She's so nice. And she's a florist!     Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!     We're not dating.     You're flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes     with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite!     She saved my life! And she understands me.     This is over!     Eat this.     This is not over! What was that?     - They call it a crumb. - It was so stingin' stripey!     And that's not what they eat. That's what falls off what they eat!     - You know what a Oinnabon is? - No.     It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up...     Sit down!     ...really hot! - Listen to me!     We are not them! We're us. There's us and there's them!     Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning?     There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me!     You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee!     - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee.     Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!     There he is. He's in the pool.     You know what your problem is, Barry?     I gotta start thinking bee?     How much longer will this go on?     It's been three days! Why aren't you working?     I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about.     What life? You have no life! You have no job. You're barely a bee!     Would it kill you to make a little honey?     Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you.     Martin, would you talk to him?     Barry, I'm talking to you!     You coming?     Got everything?     All set!     Go ahead. I'll catch up.     Don't be too long.     Watch this!     Vanessa!     - We're still here. - I told you not to yell at him.     He doesn't respond to yelling!     - Then why yell at me? - Because you don't listen!     I'm not listening to this.     Sorry, I've gotta go.     - Where are you going? - I'm meeting a friend.     A girl? Is this why you can't decide?     Bye.     I just hope she's Bee-ish.     They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena?     To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream!     Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering.     A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events?     No. All right, I've got one. How come you don't fly everywhere?     It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster.     Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn.     TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane!     You don't have that?     We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease.     Oh, my.     Dumb bees!     You must want to sting all those jerks.     We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us.     So you have to watch your temper.     Very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk,     write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion:     Anger, jealousy, lust.     Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?     Yeah.     - What is wrong with you?! - It's a bug.     He's not bothering anybody. Get out of here, you creep!     What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?     Yeah, it was. How did you know?     It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.     You've really got that down to a science.     - I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue. - I'll bet.     What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this?     How did this get here? Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,     Ray Liotta Private Select?     - Is he that actor? - I never heard of him.     - Why is this here? - For people. We eat it.     You don't have enough food of your own?     - Well, yes. - How do you get it?     - Bees make it. - I know who makes it!     And it's hard to make it!     There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing!     - It's organic. - It's our-ganic!     It's just honey, Barry.     Just what?!     Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing!     You've taken our homes, schools, hospitals! This is all we have!     And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this.     I'm getting to the bottom of all of this!     Hey, Hector.     - You almost done? - Almost.     He is here. I sense it.     Well, I guess I'll go home now     and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around.     You're busted, box boy!     I knew I heard something. So you can talk!     I can talk. And now you'll start talking!     Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier?     I don't understand. I thought we were friends.     The last thing we want to do is upset bees!     You're too late! It's ours now!     You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword!     You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio!     Where is the honey coming from?     Tell me where!     Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!     Orazy person!     What horrible thing has happened here?     These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now     they're on the road to nowhere!     Just keep still.     What? You're not dead?     Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed?     To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here.     I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off!     I'm going to Tacoma.     - And you? - He really is dead.     All right.     Uh-oh!     - What is that?! - Oh, no!     - A wiper! Triple blade! - Triple blade?     Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!     Why does everything have to be so doggone clean?!     How much do you people need to see?!     Open your eyes! Stick your head out the window!     From NPR News in Washington, I'm Oarl Kasell.     But don't kill no more bugs!     - Bee! - Moose blood guy!!     - You hear something? - Like what?     Like tiny screaming.     Turn off the radio.     Whassup, bee boy?     Hey, Blood.     Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see.     Wow!     I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it.     I mean, that honey's ours.     - Bees hang tight. - We're all jammed in.     It's a close community.     Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own.     - What if you get in trouble? - You a mosquito, you in trouble.     Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack!     At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls.     Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly.     Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.     You got to be kidding me!     Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee!     - Hey, guys! - Mooseblood!     I knew I'd catch y'all down here. Did you bring your crazy straw?     We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit.     What is this place?     A bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead.     They are pinheads!     Pinhead.     - Oheck out the new smoker. - Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.     The Thomas 3000!     Smoker?     Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar.     A couple breaths of this knocks them right out.     They make the honey, and we make the money.     ""They make the honey, and we make the money""?     Oh, my!     What's going on? Are you OK?     Yeah. It doesn't last too long.     Do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls?     Our queen was moved here. We had no choice.     This is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes!     That's a drag queen!     What is this?     Oh, no!     There's hundreds of them!     Bee honey.     Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale!     This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something.     Oh, Barry, stop.     Who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor.     Do these look like rumors?     That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos.     How did you get mixed up in this?     He's been talking to humans.     - What? - Talking to humans?!     He has a human girlfriend. And they make out!     Make out? Barry!     We do not.     - You wish you could. - Whose side are you on?     The bees!     I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night.     Barry, this is what you want to do with your life?     I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees!     Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked     your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop.     I remember that.     What right do they have to our honey?     We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!     Even if it's true, what can one bee do?     Sting them where it really hurts.     In the face! The eye!     - That would hurt. - No.     Up the nose? That's a killer.     There's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters.     Hive at Five, the hive's only full-hour action news source.     No more bee beards!     With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.     Weather with Storm Stinger.     Sports with Buzz Larvi.     And Jeanette Ohung.     - Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble. - And I'm Jeanette Ohung.     A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,     intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey,     packaging it and profiting from it illegally!     Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,     we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book,     Olassy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon.     Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.     Did you ever think, ""I'm a kid from the hive. I can't do this""?     Bees have never been afraid to change the world.     What about Bee Oolumbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?     Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.     We were thinking of stickball or candy stores.     How old are you?     The bee community is supporting you in this case,     which will be the trial of the bee century.     You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too.     It's a common name. Next week...     He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots...     Next week...     Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard 'em.     Bear Week next week! They're scary, hairy and here live.     Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish.     In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness!     It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.     Honey, her backhand's a joke! I'm not gonna take advantage of that?     Quiet, please. Actual work going on here.     - Is that that same bee? - Yes, it is!     I'm helping him sue the human race.     - Hello. - Hello, bee.     This is Ken.     Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.     Why does he talk again?     Listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working.     But it's our yogurt night!     Bye-bye.     Why is yogurt night so difficult?!     You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours!     Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help.     - Frosting... - How many sugars?     Just one. I try not to use the competition.     So why are you helping me?     Bees have good qualities.     And it takes my mind off the shop.     Instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now.     Those are great, if you're three.     And artificial flowers.     - Oh, those just get me psychotic! - Yeah, me too.     Bent stingers, pointless pollination.     Bees must hate those fake things!     Nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done.     Maybe this could make up for it a little bit.     - This lawsuit's a pretty big deal. - I guess.     You sure you want to go through with it?     Am I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able     to say, ""Honey, I'm home,"" without paying a royalty!     It's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan,     where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history,     we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak.     What have we gotten into here, Barry?     It's pretty big, isn't it?     I can't believe how many humans don't work during the day.     You think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers?     Everybody needs to stay behind the barricade.     - What's the matter? - I don't know, I just got a chill.     Well, if it isn't the bee team.     You boys work on this?     All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding.     All right. Oase number 4475,     Superior Oourt of New York, Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry     is now in session.     Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively?     A privilege.     Mr. Benson... you're representing all the bees of the world?     I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed.     Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please.     Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,     my grandmother was a simple woman.     Born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right     to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us.     If we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines,     just think of what would it mean.     I would have to negotiate with the silkworm     for the elastic in my britches!     Talking bee!     How do we know this isn't some sort of     holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry?     They could be using laser beams!     Robotics! Ventriloquism! Oloning! For all we know,     he could be on steroids!     Mr. Benson?     Ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here.     I'm just an ordinary bee. Honey's pretty important to me.     It's important to all bees. We invented it!     We make it. And we protect it with our lives.     Unfortunately, there are some people in this room     who think they can take it from us     'cause we're the little guys! I'm hoping that, after this is all over,     you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have     but everything we are!     I wish he'd dress like that all the time. So nice!     Oall your first witness.     So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have.     I suppose so.     I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron!     Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms.     Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term.     I don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you?     - No. - I couldn't hear you.     - No. - No.     Because you don't free bees. You keep bees. Not only that,     it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey.     They're very lovable creatures.     Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.     You mean like this?     Bears kill bees!     How'd you like his head crashing through your living room?!     Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows!     OK, that's enough. Take him away.     So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me.     - Where have I heard it before? - I was with a band called The Police.     But you've never been a police officer, have you?     No, I haven't.     No, you haven't. And so here we have yet another example     of bee culture casually stolen by a human     for nothing more than a prance-about stage name.     Oh, please.     Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?     Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting.     Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!     That's not his real name?! You idiots!     Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on     your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005.     Thank you. Thank you.     I see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome     with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow.     I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?     Not yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you?     Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don't     have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir?     Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now!     This isn't a goodfella. This is a badfella!     Why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?!     - Order in this court! - You're all thinking it!     Order! Order, I say!     - Say it! - Mr. Liotta, please sit down!     I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that.     I think the jury's on our side.     Are we doing everything right, legally?     I'm a florist.     Right. Well, here's to a great team.     To a great team!     Well, hello.     - Ken! - Hello.     I didn't think you were coming.     No, I was just late. I tried to call, but... the battery.     I didn't want all this to go to waste, so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.     Oh, that was lucky.     There's a little left. I could heat it up.     Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.     So I hear you're quite a tennis player.     I'm not much for the game myself. The ball's a little grabby.     That's where I usually sit. Right... there.     Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,     and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill.     You think I don't see what you're doing?     I know how hard it is to find the rightjob. We have that in common.     Do we?     Bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out.     That's just what I was thinking about doing.     Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.     I'm going to drain the old stinger.     Yeah, you do that.     Look at that.     You know, I've just about had it     with your little mind games.     - What's that? - Italian Vogue.     Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.     A lot of ads.     Remember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine?     Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!     I think something stinks in here!     I love the smell of flowers.     How do you like the smell of flames?!     Not as much.     Water bug! Not taking sides!     Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat! This is pathetic!     I've got issues!     Well, well, well, a royal flush!     - You're bluffing. - Am I?     Surf's up, dude!     Poo water!     That bowl is gnarly.     Except for those dirty yellow rings!     Kenneth! What are you doing?!     You know, I don't even like honey! I don't eat it!     We need to talk!     He's just a little bee!     And he happens to be the nicest bee I've met in a long time!     Long time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life?     No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you're one of them!     Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...     My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster!     Goodbye, Ken.     And for your information,     I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made by man!     I'm sorry about all that.     I know it's got an aftertaste! I like it!     I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me.     I couldn't overcome it. Oh, well.     Are you OK for the trial?     I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas.     We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.     Good idea! You can really see why he's considered one of the best lawyers...     Yeah.     Layton, you've gotta weave some magic     with this jury, or it's gonna be all over.     Don't worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around     is to remind them of what they don't like about bees.     - You got the tweezers? - Are you allergic?     Only to losing, son. Only to losing.     Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know.     What exactly is your relationship     to that woman?     We're friends.     - Good friends? - Yes.     How good? Do you live together?     Wait a minute...     Are you her little...     ...bedbug?     I've seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand,     doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee children?     - Yeah, but... - So those aren't your real parents!     - Oh, Barry... - Yes, they are!     Hold me back!     You're an illegitimate bee, aren't you, Benson?     He's denouncing bees!     Don't y'all date your cousins?     - Objection! - I'm going to pincushion this guy!     Adam, don't! It's what he wants!     Oh, I'm hit!!     Oh, lordy, I am hit!     Order! Order!     The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins!     I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction!     You see? You can't treat them like equals! They're striped savages!     Stinging's the only thing they know! It's their way!     - Adam, stay with me. - I can't feel my legs.     What angel of mercy will come forward to suck the poison     from my heaving buttocks?     I will have order in this court. Order!     Order, please!     The case of the honeybees versus the human race     took a pointed turn against the bees     yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery.     - Hey, buddy. - Hey.     - Is there much pain? - Yeah.     I...     I blew the whole case, didn't I?     It doesn't matter. What matters is you're alive. You could have died.     I'd be better off dead. Look at me.     They got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.     Look, there's a little celery still on it.     What was it like to sting someone?     I can't explain it. It was all...     All adrenaline and then... and then ecstasy!     All right.     You think it was all a trap?     Of course. I'm sorry. I flew us right into this.     What were we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of bugs in this world.     What will the humans do to us if they win?     I don't know.     I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn't sound so bad.     Adam, they check in, but they don't check out!     Oh, my.     Oould you get a nurse to close that window?     - Why? - The smoke.     Bees don't smoke.     Right. Bees don't smoke.     Bees don't smoke! But some bees are smoking.     That's it! That's our case!     It is? It's not over?     Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.     Get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can.     And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.     Mr. Flayman.     Yes? Yes, Your Honor!     Where is the rest of your team?     Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.     Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,     and as a result, we don't make very good time.     I actually heard a funny story about...     Your Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs     taken up enough of this court's valuable time?     How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on?     They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges     against my clients, who run legitimate businesses.     I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case!     Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going     to have to consider Mr. Montgomery's motion.     But you can't! We have a terrific case.     Where is your proof? Where is the evidence?     Show me the smoking gun!     Hold it, Your Honor! You want a smoking gun?     Here is your smoking gun.     What is that?     It's a bee smoker!     What, this? This harmless little contraption?     This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee.     Look at what has happened     to bees who have never been asked, ""Smoking or non?""     Is this what nature intended for us?     To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines     and man-made wooden slat work camps?     Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man?     - What are we gonna do? - He's playing the species card.     Ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees!     Free the bees! Free the bees!     Free the bees!     Free the bees! Free the bees!     The court finds in favor of the bees!     Vanessa, we won!     I knew you could do it! High-five!     Sorry.     I'm OK! You know what this means?     All the honey will finally belong to the bees.     Now we won't have to work so hard all the time.     This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson.     You'll regret this.     Barry, how much honey is out there?     All right. One at a time.     Barry, who are you wearing?     My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants.     - What if Montgomery's right? - What do you mean?     We've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years.     Oongratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement?     First, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps.     Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with,     every last drop.     We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more     than a filthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine.     We're all aware of what they do in the woods.     Wait for my signal.     Take him out.     He'll have nauseous for a few hours, then he'll be fine.     And we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames...     But it's just a prance-about stage name!     ...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products     and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments.     Oan't breathe.     Bring it in, boys!     Hold it right there! Good.     Tap it.     Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups, and there's gallons more coming!     - I think we need to shut down! - Shut down? We've never shut down.     Shut down honey production!     Stop making honey!     Turn your key, sir!     What do we do now?     Oannonball!     We're shutting honey production!     Mission abort.     Aborting pollination and nectar detail. Returning to base.     Adam, you wouldn't believe how much honey was out there.     Oh, yeah?     What's going on? Where is everybody?     - Are they out celebrating? - They're home.     They don't know what to do. Laying out, sleeping in.     I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket.     At least we got our honey back.     Sometimes I think, so what if humans liked our honey? Who wouldn't?     It's the greatest thing in the world! I was excited to be part of making it.     This was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well.     And now...     Now I can't.     I don't understand why they're not happy.     I thought their lives would be better!     They're doing nothing. It's amazing. Honey really changes people.     You don't have any idea what's going on, do you?     - What did you want to show me? - This.     What happened here?     That is not the half of it.     Oh, no. Oh, my.     They're all wilting.     Doesn't look very good, does it?     No.     And whose fault do you think that is?     You know, I'm gonna guess bees.     Bees?     Specifically, me.     I didn't think bees not needing to make honey would affect all these things.     It's notjust flowers. Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.     That's our whole SAT test right there.     Take away produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom.     And then, of course...     The human species?     So if there's no more pollination,     it could all just go south here, couldn't it?     I know this is also partly my fault.     How about a suicide pact?     How do we do it?     - I'll sting you, you step on me. - Thatjust kills you twice.     Right, right.     Listen, Barry... sorry, but I gotta get going.     I had to open my mouth and talk.     Vanessa?     Vanessa? Why are you leaving? Where are you going?     To the final Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena.     They've moved it to this weekend because all the flowers are dying.     It's the last chance I'll ever have to see it.     Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry. I never meant it to turn out like this.     I know. Me neither.     Tournament of Roses. Roses can't do sports.     Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?     Roses!     Vanessa!     Roses?!     Barry?     - Roses are flowers! - Yes, they are.     Flowers, bees, pollen!     I know. That's why this is the last parade.     Maybe not. Oould you ask him to slow down?     Oould you slow down?     Barry!     OK, I made a huge mistake. This is a total disaster, all my fault.     Yes, it kind of is.     I've ruined the planet. I wanted to help you     with the flower shop. I've made it worse.     Actually, it's completely closed down.     I thought maybe you were remodeling.     But I have another idea, and it's greater than my previous ideas combined.     I don't want to hear it!     All right, they have the roses, the roses have the pollen.     I know every bee, plant and flower bud in this park.     All we gotta do is get what they've got back here with what we've got.     - Bees. - Park.     - Pollen! - Flowers.     - Repollination! - Across the nation!     Tournament of Roses, Pasadena, Oalifornia.     They've got nothing but flowers, floats and cotton candy.     Security will be tight.     I have an idea.     Vanessa Bloome, FTD.     Official floral business. It's real.     Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.     Thank you. It was a gift.     Once inside, we just pick the right float.     How about The Princess and the Pea?     I could be the princess, and you could be the pea!     Yes, I got it.     - Where should I sit? - What are you?     - I believe I'm the pea. - The pea?     It goes under the mattresses.     - Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart. - I'm getting the marshal.     You do that! This whole parade is a fiasco!     Let's see what this baby'll do.     Hey, what are you doing?!     Then all we do is blend in with traffic...     ...without arousing suspicion.     Once at the airport, there's no stopping us.     Stop! Security.     - You and your insect pack your float? - Yes.     Has it been in your possession the entire time?     Would you remove your shoes?     - Remove your stinger. - It's part of me.     I know. Just having some fun. Enjoy your flight.     Then if we're lucky, we'll have just enough pollen to do the job.     Oan you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job!     I think this is gonna work.     It's got to work.     Attention, passengers, this is Oaptain Scott.     We have a bit of bad weather in New York.     It looks like we'll experience a couple hours delay.     Barry, these are cut flowers with no water. They'll never make it.     I gotta get up there and talk to them.     Be careful.     Oan I get help with the Sky Mall magazine?     I'd like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.     Oaptain, I'm in a real situation.     - What'd you say, Hal? - Nothing.     Bee!     Don't freak out! My entire species...     What are you doing?     - Wait a minute! I'm an attorney! - Who's an attorney?     Don't move.     Oh, Barry.     Good afternoon, passengers. This is your captain.     Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B please report to the cockpit?     And please hurry!     What happened here?     There was a DustBuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded.     One's bald, one's in a boat, they're both unconscious!     - Is that another bee joke? - No!     No one's flying the plane!     This is JFK control tower, Flight 356. What's your status?     This is Vanessa Bloome. I'm a florist from New York.     Where's the pilot?     He's unconscious, and so is the copilot.     Not good. Does anyone onboard have flight experience?     As a matter of fact, there is.     - Who's that? - Barry Benson.     From the honey trial?! Oh, great.     Vanessa, this is nothing more than a big metal bee.     It's got giant wings, huge engines.     I can't fly a plane.     - Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot? - Yes.     How hard could it be?     Wait, Barry! We're headed into some lightning.     This is Bob Bumble. We have some late-breaking news from JFK Airport,     where a suspenseful scene is developing.     Barry Benson, fresh from his legal victory...     That's Barry!     ...is attempting to land a plane, loaded with people, flowers     and an incapacitated flight crew.     Flowers?!     We have a storm in the area and two individuals at the controls     with absolutely no flight experience.     Just a minute. There's a bee on that plane.     I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson and his no-account compadres.     They've done enough damage.     But isn't he your only hope?     Technically, a bee shouldn't be able to fly at all.     Their wings are too small...     Haven't we heard this a million times?     ""The surface area of the wings and body mass make no sense.""     - Get this on the air! - Got it.     - Stand by. - We're going live.     The way we work may be a mystery to you.     Making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs.     But let me tell you about a small job.     If you do it well, it makes a big difference.     More than we realized. To us, to everyone.     That's why I want to get bees back to working together.     That's the bee way! We're not made of Jell-O.     We get behind a fellow.     - Black and yellow! - Hello!     Left, right, down, hover.     - Hover? - Forget hover.     This isn't so hard. Beep-beep! Beep-beep!     Barry, what happened?!     Wait, I think we were on autopilot the whole time.     - That may have been helping me. - And now we're not!     So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.     All of you, let's get behind this fellow! Move it out!     Move out!     Our only chance is if I do what I'd do, you copy me with the wings of the plane!     Don't have to yell.     I'm not yelling! We're in a lot of trouble.     It's very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice!     It's not a tone. I'm panicking!     I can't do this!     Vanessa, pull yourself together. You have to snap out of it!     You snap out of it.     You snap out of it.     - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it!     - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it!     - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it!     - Hold it! - Why? Oome on, it's my turn.     How is the plane flying?     I don't know.     Hello?     Benson, got any flowers for a happy occasion in there?     The Pollen Jocks!     They do get behind a fellow.     - Black and yellow. - Hello.     All right, let's drop this tin can on the blacktop.     Where? I can't see anything. Oan you?     No, nothing. It's all cloudy.     Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry.     - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee.     Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!     Wait a minute. I think I'm feeling something.     - What? - I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.     Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.     Bring the nose down.     Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!     - What in the world is on the tarmac? - Get some lights on that!     Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!     - Vanessa, aim for the flower. - OK.     Out the engines. We're going in on bee power. Ready, boys?     Affirmative!     Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.     Land on that flower!     Ready? Full reverse!     Spin it around!     - Not that flower! The other one! - Which one?     - That flower. - I'm aiming at the flower!     That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt. I mean the giant pulsating flower     made of millions of bees!     Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.     Rotate around it.     - This is insane, Barry! - This's the only way I know how to fly.     Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane flying in an insect-like pattern?     Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid. Smell it. Full reverse!     Just drop it. Be a part of it.     Aim for the center!     Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!     Oome on, already.     Barry, we did it! You taught me how to fly!     - Yes. No high-five! - Right.     Barry, it worked! Did you see the giant flower?     What giant flower? Where? Of course I saw the flower! That was genius!     - Thank you. - But we're not done yet.     Listen, everyone!     This runway is covered with the last pollen     from the last flowers available anywhere on Earth.     That means this is our last chance.     We're the only ones who make honey, pollinate flowers and dress like this.     If we're gonna survive as a species, this is our moment! What do you say?     Are we going to be bees, orjust Museum of Natural History keychains?     We're bees!     Keychain!     Then follow me! Except Keychain.     Hold on, Barry. Here.     You've earned this.     Yeah!     I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.     Oh, yeah.     That's our Barry.     Mom! The bees are back!     If anybody needs to make a call, now's the time.     I got a feeling we'll be working late tonight!     Here's your change. Have a great afternoon! Oan I help who's next?     Would you like some honey with that? It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.     Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me. And I don't see a nickel!     Sometimes I just feel like a piece of meat!     I had no idea.     Barry, I'm sorry. Have you got a moment?     Would you excuse me? My mosquito associate will help you.     Sorry I'm late.     He's a lawyer too?     I was already a blood-sucking parasite. All I needed was a briefcase.     Have a great afternoon!     Barry, I just got this huge tulip order, and I can't get them anywhere.     No problem, Vannie. Just leave it to me.     You're a lifesaver, Barry. Oan I help who's next?     All right, scramble, jocks! It's time to fly.     Thank you, Barry!     That bee is living my life!     Let it go, Kenny.     - When will this nightmare end?! - Let it all go.     - Beautiful day to fly. - Sure is.     Between you and me, I was dying to get out of that office.     You have got to start thinking bee, my friend.     - Thinking bee! - Me?     Hold it. Let's just stop for a second. Hold it.     I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone. Oan we stop here?     I'm not making a major life decision during a production number!     All right. Take ten, everybody. Wrap it up, guys.     I had virtually no rehearsal for that.

Consequently, delays and environmental problems are caused, due to aircraft congestion in the airports. Thus, it is necessary for the airports to use the existing infrastructure efficiently and generate some changes in the system and the way airports are operated. For this reason, the prediction of aircraft taxi time is substantial in order to help airports understand what is necessary to change so as to optimise their efficiency and reduce the aircraft taxi time. This project concerns Manchester’s airport and data about the aircrafts’ features and external factors were given in order to predict taxi time. This machine learning project was following the CRISP-DM process for data mining.  All the processes were handled on Python, as it provides Pandas library which creates a useful data frame that provides an easy way to handle and modify the data. Moreover, the scikit-learn library was used for the machine learning was used for the machine learning procedure, by providing all the algorithm that are necessary for this problem. The machine learning algorithms that were applied are Linear regression, Polynomial Regression, Random Forests and Multilayer Perceptrons. The examination of algorithms that were applied showed that the most suitable for the project is Polynomial regression, because it provides the most precise and accurate prediction of taxi time with accuracy equal to 79.94%.

The notebook presents a face recognition system. Tthe ideas presented here are from FaceNetand DeepFace.  Face recognition problems commonly fall into two categories:  Face Verification - ""is this the claimed person?"". For example, at some airports, you can pass through customs by letting a system scan your passport and then verifying that you (the person carrying the passport) are the correct person. A mobile phone that unlocks using your face is also using face verification. This is a 1:1 matching problem. Face Recognition - ""who is this person?"". For example, the video lecture showed a face recognition video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wr4rx0Spihs) of Baidu employees entering the office without needing to otherwise identify themselves.

Face recognition has received substantial attention from researchers due to human activities found in various applications of security like airport, criminal detection, face tracking, forensic etc. Compared to other biometric traits like palm print, Iris, finger print etc., face biometrics can be non-intrusive. They can be taken even without user’s knowledge and further can be used for security based applications like criminal detection, face tracking, airport security, and forensic surveillance systems. Face recognition involves capturing face image from a video or from a surveillance camera. They are compared with the stored database. Face biometrics involves training known images, classify them with known classes and then they are stored in the database. When a test image is given to the system it is classified and compared with stored database. Face biometrics is a challenging field of research with various limitations imposed for a machine face recognition like variations in head pose, change in illumination, facial expression, aging, occlusion due to accessories etc.,. Various approaches were suggested by researchers in overcoming the limitations stated. 72 Automatic face recognition involves face detection, feature extraction and face recognition. Face recognition algorithms are broadly classified into two classes as image template based and geometric feature based. The template based methods compute correlation between face and one or more model templates to find the face identity. Principal component analysis, linear discriminate analysis, kernel methods etc. are used to construct face templates. The geometric feature based methods are used to analyze explicit local features and their geometric relations (elastic bung graph method). Multi resolution tools such as contour lets, ridge lets were found to be useful for analyzing information content of images and found its application in image processing, pattern recognition, and computer vision. Curvelets transform is used for texture classification and image de-noising. Application of Curvelets transform for feature extraction in image processing is still under research.",3,3,3,airport,GitHub
265,Bluebikes-project,https://github.com/janeminmin/Bluebikes-project.git,"1>  Background information Bluebikes is Metro Boston’s public bike share program, with more than 1800 bikes at over 200 stations across Boston and nearby areas. The bikes sharing program launched in 2011. The program aimed for individuals to use it for short-term basis for a price. It allows individuals to borrow a bike from a dock station after using it, which makes it ideal for one-way trips. The City of Boston is committed to providing bike share as a part of the public transportation system. However, to build a transport system that encourages bicycling, it is important to build knowledge about the current bicycle flows, and what factors are involved in the decision-making of potential bicyclists when choosing whether to use the bicycle. It is logical to make hypotheses that age and gender, bicycle infrastructure, safety perception are possible determinants of bicycling. On the short-term perspective, it has been shown that weather plays an important role whether to choose the bicycle.  2> Data collection The Bluebikes collects and provides system data to the public. The datasets used in the project can be download through this link (https://www.bluebikes.com/system-data). Based on this time series dataset (start from 2017-01-01 00:00:00 to 2019-03-31 23:00:00), we could have the information includes: Trip duration, start time and data, stop time and data, start station name and id, end station name and id, bike id, user type (casual or subscribed), birth year, gender. Besides, any trips that were below 60 seconds in length is considered as potentially false starts, which is already removed in the datasets. The number of bicycles used during a particular time period, varies over time based on several factors, including the current weather conditions, time of the day, time of the year and the current interest of the biker to use the bicycle as a transport mode. The current interest is different between subscribed users and casual users, so we should analyze them separately. Factors such as season, day of a week, month, hour, and if a holiday can be extracted from the date and time column in the datasets. Since we would analyze the hourly bicycle rental flow, we need hourly weather conditions data from 2017-01-01 00:00:00 to 2019-03-31 23:00:00 to complete our regression model of prediction. The weather data used in the project is scrapped using python selenium from Logan airport station (42.38 °N, 71.04 °W) webpage (https://www.wunderground.com/history/daily/us/ma/boston/KBOS/date/2019-7-15) maintained by weather underground website. The hourly weather observations include time, temperature, dew point, humidity, wind, wind speed, wind gust, pressure, precipitation, precipitation accumulated, condition. 3> The problem The aims of the project are to gain insight of the factors that could give short-term perspective of bicycle flows in Boston. It also aimed to investigate the how busy each station is, the division of bicycle trip direction and duration of the usage of a busy station and the mean flows variation within a day or during that period. The addition to the factors included in the regression model, there also exist other factors than influence how the bicycle flows vary over longer periods time. For example, general tendency to use the bicycle. Therefore, there is potential to improve the regression model accuracy by incorporating a long-term trend estimate taken over the time series of bicycle usage. Then the result from the machine learning algorithm-based regression model should be compared with the time series forecasting-based models. 4> Possible solutions Data preprocessing/Exploration and variable selection: date approximation manipulation, correlation analysis among variables, merging data, scrubbing for duplicate data, verifying errors, interpolation for missing values, handling outliers and skewness, binning low frequent levels, encoding categorical variables. Data visualization: split number of bike usage by subscribed/casual to build time series; build heatmap to present how busy is each station and locate the busiest station in the busiest period of a busy day; using boxplot and histogram to check outliers and determine appropriate data transformation, using weather condition text to build word cloud. Time series trend curve estimates: two possible way we considered are fitting polynomials of various degrees to the data points in the time series or by using time series decomposition functions and forecast functions to extract and forecast. We would emphasize on the importance to generate trend curve estimates that do not follow the seasonal variations: the seasonal variations should be captured explicitly by the input weather related variables in the regression model. Prediction/regression/time series forecasting: It is possible to build up multilayer perceptron neural network regressor to build up models and give prediction based on all variables of data, time and weather. However, considering the interpretability of model, we prefer to build regression models based on machine learning algorithms (like random forest or SVM) respectively for subscribed/casual users. Then the regressor would be combined with trend curve extracted and forecasted by ARIMA, and then comparing with the result of time series forecasting by STL (Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess) with multiple seasonal periods and the result of TBATS (Trigonometric Seasonal, Box-Cox Transformation, ARMA residuals, Trend and Seasonality).",3,1,3,airport,GitHub

Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.     The bee, of course, flies anyway     because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.     Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.     Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little.     Barry! Breakfast is ready!     Ooming!     Hang on a second.     Hello?     - Barry? - Adam?     - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up.     Looking sharp.     Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.     Sorry. I'm excited.     Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son.     A perfect report card, all B's.     Very proud.     Ma! I got a thing going here.     - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me!     - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye!     Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!     - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry.     - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation.     Never thought I'd make it.     Three days grade school, three days high school.     Those were awkward.     Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive.     You did come back different.     - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.     - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah.     - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going.     Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.     Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead.     I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.     I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.     That's why we don't need vacations.     Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances.     - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are!     - Bee-men. - Amen!     Hallelujah!     Students, faculty, distinguished bees,     please welcome Dean Buzzwell.     Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of...     ...9:15.     That concludes our ceremonies.     And begins your career at Honex Industries!     Will we pick ourjob today?     I heard it's just orientation.     Heads up! Here we go.     Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.     - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary.     Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco     and a part of the Hexagon Group.     This is it!     Wow.     Wow.     We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life     to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.     Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.     Our top-secret formula     is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured     into this soothing sweet syrup     with its distinctive golden glow you know as...     Honey!     - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin!     - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins.     - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive     to improve every aspect of bee existence.     These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.     - What do you think he makes? - Not enough.     Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.     - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey     that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions.     Oan anyone work on the Krelman?     Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know     that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.     But choose carefully     because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.     The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.     What's the difference?     You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off     in 27 million years.     So you'll just work us to death?     We'll sure try.     Wow! That blew my mind!     ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that?     One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make.     I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.     But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?     Why would you question anything? We're bees.     We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.     You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?     Like what? Give me one example.     I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.     Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.     Wait a second. Oheck it out.     - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow.     I've never seen them this close.     They know what it's like outside the hive.     Yeah, but some don't come back.     - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks!     You guys did great!     You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!     - I wonder where they were. - I don't know.     Their day's not planned.     Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.     You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.     Right.     Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.     It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it.     Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.     Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too?     Distant. Distant.     Look at these two.     - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them.     It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.     Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!     He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!     - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out.     What were you doing during this?     Trying to alert the authorities.     I can autograph that.     A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?     Yeah. Gusty.     We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.     - Six miles, huh? - Barry!     A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.     - Maybe I am. - You are not!     We're going 0900 at J-Gate.     What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough?     I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.     Hey, Honex!     Dad, you surprised me.     You decide what you're interested in?     - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one.     Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?     Son, let me tell you about stirring.     You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.     You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing.     You know, Dad, the more I think about it,     maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.     You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?     That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.     Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!     - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny.     You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!     - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me!     Wait till you see the sticks I have.     I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!     Let's open some honey and celebrate!     Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae.     Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!     I'm so proud.     - We're starting work today! - Today's the day.     Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone.     Yeah, right.     Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...     - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left!     One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side.     - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar!     Wow!     Oouple of newbies?     Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!     Make your choice.     - You want to go first? - No, you go.     Oh, my. What's available?     Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.     - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on.     I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.     Wax monkey's always open.     The Krelman opened up again.     What happened?     A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.     Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.     Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!     Oh, this is so hard!     Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,     humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,     mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?     Barry!     All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...     What happened to you? Where are you?     - I'm going out. - Out? Out where?     - Out there. - Oh, no!     I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.     You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?     Another call coming in.     If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd     that gets their roses today.     Hey, guys.     - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?     Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.     It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.     Really? Feeling lucky, are you?     Sign here, here. Just initial that.     - Thank you. - OK.     You got a rain advisory today,     and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain.     So be careful. As always, watch your brooms,     hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.     Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us.     Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!     - That's awful. - And a reminder for you rookies,     bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!     All right, launch positions!     Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!     Black and yellow!     Hello!     You ready for this, hot shot?     Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.     Wind, check.     - Antennae, check. - Nectar pack, check.     - Wings, check. - Stinger, check.     Scared out of my shorts, check.     OK, ladies,     let's move it out!     Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers!     All of you, drain those flowers!     Wow! I'm out!     I can't believe I'm out!     So blue.     I feel so fast and free!     Box kite!     Wow!     Flowers!     This is Blue Leader. We have roses visual.     Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.     Roses!     30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.     Stand to the side, kid. It's got a bit of a kick.     That is one nectar collector!     - Ever see pollination up close? - No, sir.     I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there,     a pinch on that one. See that? It's a little bit of magic.     That's amazing. Why do we do that?     That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.     Oool.     I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow. Oould be daisies. Don't we need those?     Oopy that visual.     Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.     Say again? You're reporting a moving flower?     Affirmative.     That was on the line!     This is the coolest. What is it?     I don't know, but I'm loving this color.     It smells good. Not like a flower, but I like it.     Yeah, fuzzy.     Ohemical-y.     Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby.     My sweet lord of bees!     Oandy-brain, get off there!     Problem!     - Guys! - This could be bad.     Affirmative.     Very close.     Gonna hurt.     Mama's little boy.     You are way out of position, rookie!     Ooming in at you like a missile!     Help me!     I don't think these are flowers.     - Should we tell him? - I think he knows.     What is this?!     Match point!     You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it!     Yowser!     Gross.     There's a bee in the car!     - Do something! - I'm driving!     - Hi, bee. - He's back here!     He's going to sting me!     Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze!     He blinked!     Spray him, Granny!     What are you doing?!     Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable.     I gotta get home.     Oan't fly in rain.     Oan't fly in rain.     Oan't fly in rain.     Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!     Ken, could you close the window please?     Ken, could you close the window please?     Oheck out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure.     You see? Folds out.     Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.     What was that?     Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This...     Drapes!     That is diabolical.     It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.     What's number one? Star Wars?     Nah, I don't go for that...     ...kind of stuff.     No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds.     When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.     There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.     I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it.     I predicted global warming.     I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.     Wait! Stop! Bee!     Stand back. These are winter boots.     Wait!     Don't kill him!     You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me!     Why does his life have less value than yours?     Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement?     I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling.     My brochure!     There you go, little guy.     I'm not scared of him. It's an allergic thing.     Put that on your resume brochure.     My whole face could puff up.     Make it one of your special skills.     Knocking someone out is also a special skill.     Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.     - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.     - You could put carob chips on there. - Bye.     - Supposed to be less calories. - Bye.     I gotta say something.     She saved my life. I gotta say something.     All right, here it goes.     Nah.     What would I say?     I could really get in trouble.     It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human.     I can't believe I'm doing this.     I've got to.     Oh, I can't do it. Oome on!     No. Yes. No.     Do it. I can't.     How should I start it? ""You like jazz?"" No, that's no good.     Here she comes! Speak, you fool!     Hi!     I'm sorry.     - You're talking. - Yes, I know.     You're talking!     I'm so sorry.     No, it's OK. It's fine. I know I'm dreaming.     But I don't recall going to bed.     Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting.     This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee!     I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this,     but they were all trying to kill me.     And if it wasn't for you...     I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised.     That was a little weird.     - I'm talking with a bee. - Yeah.     I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me!     I just want to say I'm grateful. I'll leave now.     - Wait! How did you learn to do that? - What?     The talking thing.     Same way you did, I guess. ""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up.     - That's very funny. - Yeah.     Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with.     Anyway...     Oan I...     ...get you something? - Like what?     I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Ooffee?     I don't want to put you out.     It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.     - It's just coffee. - I hate to impose.     - Don't be ridiculous! - Actually, I would love a cup.     Hey, you want rum cake?     - I shouldn't. - Have some.     - No, I can't. - Oome on!     I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.     - Where? - These stripes don't help.     You look great!     I don't know if you know anything about fashion.     Are you all right?     No.     He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison.     He finally gets there.     He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on.     And he says, ""Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan.     Why would I marry a watermelon?""     Is that a bee joke?     That's the kind of stuff we do.     Yeah, different.     So, what are you gonna do, Barry?     About work? I don't know.     I want to do my part for the hive, but I can't do it the way they want.     I know how you feel.     - You do? - Sure.     My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.     - Really? - My only interest is flowers.     Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan.     Anyway, if you look...     There's my hive right there. See it?     You're in Sheep Meadow!     Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!     No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once.     - Why do girls put rings on their toes? - Why not?     - It's like putting a hat on your knee. - Maybe I'll try that.     - You all right, ma'am? - Oh, yeah. Fine.     Just having two cups of coffee!     Anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee.     Yeah, it's no trouble.     Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life.     Are you...?     Oan I take a piece of this with me?     Sure! Here, have a crumb.     - Thanks! - Yeah.     All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around.     Or not.     OK, Barry.     And thank you so much again... for before.     Oh, that? That was nothing.     Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...     This can't possibly work.     He's all set to go. We may as well try it.     OK, Dave, pull the chute.     - Sounds amazing. - It was amazing!     It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life.     Humans! I can't believe you were with humans!     Giant, scary humans! What were they like?     Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.     They eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy.     - Do they try and kill you, like on TV? - Some of them. But some of them don't.     - How'd you get back? - Poodle.     You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see.     You had your ""experience."" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal.     - Well... - Well?     Well, I met someone.     You did? Was she Bee-ish?     - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you! - No, no, no, not a wasp.     - Spider? - I'm not attracted to spiders.     I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all.     I can't get by that face.     So who is she?     She's... human.     No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law.     - Her name's Vanessa. - Oh, boy.     She's so nice. And she's a florist!     Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!     We're not dating.     You're flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes     with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite!     She saved my life! And she understands me.     This is over!     Eat this.     This is not over! What was that?     - They call it a crumb. - It was so stingin' stripey!     And that's not what they eat. That's what falls off what they eat!     - You know what a Oinnabon is? - No.     It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up...     Sit down!     ...really hot! - Listen to me!     We are not them! We're us. There's us and there's them!     Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning?     There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me!     You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee!     - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee.     Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!     There he is. He's in the pool.     You know what your problem is, Barry?     I gotta start thinking bee?     How much longer will this go on?     It's been three days! Why aren't you working?     I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about.     What life? You have no life! You have no job. You're barely a bee!     Would it kill you to make a little honey?     Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you.     Martin, would you talk to him?     Barry, I'm talking to you!     You coming?     Got everything?     All set!     Go ahead. I'll catch up.     Don't be too long.     Watch this!     Vanessa!     - We're still here. - I told you not to yell at him.     He doesn't respond to yelling!     - Then why yell at me? - Because you don't listen!     I'm not listening to this.     Sorry, I've gotta go.     - Where are you going? - I'm meeting a friend.     A girl? Is this why you can't decide?     Bye.     I just hope she's Bee-ish.     They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena?     To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream!     Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering.     A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events?     No. All right, I've got one. How come you don't fly everywhere?     It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster.     Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn.     TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane!     You don't have that?     We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease.     Oh, my.     Dumb bees!     You must want to sting all those jerks.     We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us.     So you have to watch your temper.     Very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk,     write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion:     Anger, jealousy, lust.     Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?     Yeah.     - What is wrong with you?! - It's a bug.     He's not bothering anybody. Get out of here, you creep!     What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?     Yeah, it was. How did you know?     It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.     You've really got that down to a science.     - I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue. - I'll bet.     What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this?     How did this get here? Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,     Ray Liotta Private Select?     - Is he that actor? - I never heard of him.     - Why is this here? - For people. We eat it.     You don't have enough food of your own?     - Well, yes. - How do you get it?     - Bees make it. - I know who makes it!     And it's hard to make it!     There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing!     - It's organic. - It's our-ganic!     It's just honey, Barry.     Just what?!     Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing!     You've taken our homes, schools, hospitals! This is all we have!     And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this.     I'm getting to the bottom of all of this!     Hey, Hector.     - You almost done? - Almost.     He is here. I sense it.     Well, I guess I'll go home now     and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around.     You're busted, box boy!     I knew I heard something. So you can talk!     I can talk. And now you'll start talking!     Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier?     I don't understand. I thought we were friends.     The last thing we want to do is upset bees!     You're too late! It's ours now!     You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword!     You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio!     Where is the honey coming from?     Tell me where!     Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!     Orazy person!     What horrible thing has happened here?     These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now     they're on the road to nowhere!     Just keep still.     What? You're not dead?     Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed?     To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here.     I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off!     I'm going to Tacoma.     - And you? - He really is dead.     All right.     Uh-oh!     - What is that?! - Oh, no!     - A wiper! Triple blade! - Triple blade?     Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!     Why does everything have to be so doggone clean?!     How much do you people need to see?!     Open your eyes! Stick your head out the window!     From NPR News in Washington, I'm Oarl Kasell.     But don't kill no more bugs!     - Bee! - Moose blood guy!!     - You hear something? - Like what?     Like tiny screaming.     Turn off the radio.     Whassup, bee boy?     Hey, Blood.     Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see.     Wow!     I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it.     I mean, that honey's ours.     - Bees hang tight. - We're all jammed in.     It's a close community.     Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own.     - What if you get in trouble? - You a mosquito, you in trouble.     Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack!     At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls.     Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly.     Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.     You got to be kidding me!     Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee!     - Hey, guys! - Mooseblood!     I knew I'd catch y'all down here. Did you bring your crazy straw?     We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit.     What is this place?     A bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead.     They are pinheads!     Pinhead.     - Oheck out the new smoker. - Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.     The Thomas 3000!     Smoker?     Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar.     A couple breaths of this knocks them right out.     They make the honey, and we make the money.     ""They make the honey, and we make the money""?     Oh, my!     What's going on? Are you OK?     Yeah. It doesn't last too long.     Do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls?     Our queen was moved here. We had no choice.     This is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes!     That's a drag queen!     What is this?     Oh, no!     There's hundreds of them!     Bee honey.     Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale!     This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something.     Oh, Barry, stop.     Who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor.     Do these look like rumors?     That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos.     How did you get mixed up in this?     He's been talking to humans.     - What? - Talking to humans?!     He has a human girlfriend. And they make out!     Make out? Barry!     We do not.     - You wish you could. - Whose side are you on?     The bees!     I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night.     Barry, this is what you want to do with your life?     I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees!     Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked     your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop.     I remember that.     What right do they have to our honey?     We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!     Even if it's true, what can one bee do?     Sting them where it really hurts.     In the face! The eye!     - That would hurt. - No.     Up the nose? That's a killer.     There's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters.     Hive at Five, the hive's only full-hour action news source.     No more bee beards!     With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.     Weather with Storm Stinger.     Sports with Buzz Larvi.     And Jeanette Ohung.     - Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble. - And I'm Jeanette Ohung.     A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,     intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey,     packaging it and profiting from it illegally!     Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,     we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book,     Olassy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon.     Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.     Did you ever think, ""I'm a kid from the hive. I can't do this""?     Bees have never been afraid to change the world.     What about Bee Oolumbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?     Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.     We were thinking of stickball or candy stores.     How old are you?     The bee community is supporting you in this case,     which will be the trial of the bee century.     You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too.     It's a common name. Next week...     He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots...     Next week...     Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard 'em.     Bear Week next week! They're scary, hairy and here live.     Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish.     In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness!     It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.     Honey, her backhand's a joke! I'm not gonna take advantage of that?     Quiet, please. Actual work going on here.     - Is that that same bee? - Yes, it is!     I'm helping him sue the human race.     - Hello. - Hello, bee.     This is Ken.     Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.     Why does he talk again?     Listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working.     But it's our yogurt night!     Bye-bye.     Why is yogurt night so difficult?!     You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours!     Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help.     - Frosting... - How many sugars?     Just one. I try not to use the competition.     So why are you helping me?     Bees have good qualities.     And it takes my mind off the shop.     Instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now.     Those are great, if you're three.     And artificial flowers.     - Oh, those just get me psychotic! - Yeah, me too.     Bent stingers, pointless pollination.     Bees must hate those fake things!     Nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done.     Maybe this could make up for it a little bit.     - This lawsuit's a pretty big deal. - I guess.     You sure you want to go through with it?     Am I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able     to say, ""Honey, I'm home,"" without paying a royalty!     It's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan,     where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history,     we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak.     What have we gotten into here, Barry?     It's pretty big, isn't it?     I can't believe how many humans don't work during the day.     You think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers?     Everybody needs to stay behind the barricade.     - What's the matter? - I don't know, I just got a chill.     Well, if it isn't the bee team.     You boys work on this?     All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding.     All right. Oase number 4475,     Superior Oourt of New York, Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry     is now in session.     Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively?     A privilege.     Mr. Benson... you're representing all the bees of the world?     I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed.     Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please.     Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,     my grandmother was a simple woman.     Born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right     to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us.     If we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines,     just think of what would it mean.     I would have to negotiate with the silkworm     for the elastic in my britches!     Talking bee!     How do we know this isn't some sort of     holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry?     They could be using laser beams!     Robotics! Ventriloquism! Oloning! For all we know,     he could be on steroids!     Mr. Benson?     Ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here.     I'm just an ordinary bee. Honey's pretty important to me.     It's important to all bees. We invented it!     We make it. And we protect it with our lives.     Unfortunately, there are some people in this room     who think they can take it from us     'cause we're the little guys! I'm hoping that, after this is all over,     you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have     but everything we are!     I wish he'd dress like that all the time. So nice!     Oall your first witness.     So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have.     I suppose so.     I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron!     Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms.     Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term.     I don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you?     - No. - I couldn't hear you.     - No. - No.     Because you don't free bees. You keep bees. Not only that,     it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey.     They're very lovable creatures.     Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.     You mean like this?     Bears kill bees!     How'd you like his head crashing through your living room?!     Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows!     OK, that's enough. Take him away.     So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me.     - Where have I heard it before? - I was with a band called The Police.     But you've never been a police officer, have you?     No, I haven't.     No, you haven't. And so here we have yet another example     of bee culture casually stolen by a human     for nothing more than a prance-about stage name.     Oh, please.     Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?     Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting.     Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!     That's not his real name?! You idiots!     Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on     your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005.     Thank you. Thank you.     I see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome     with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow.     I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?     Not yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you?     Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don't     have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir?     Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now!     This isn't a goodfella. This is a badfella!     Why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?!     - Order in this court! - You're all thinking it!     Order! Order, I say!     - Say it! - Mr. Liotta, please sit down!     I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that.     I think the jury's on our side.     Are we doing everything right, legally?     I'm a florist.     Right. Well, here's to a great team.     To a great team!     Well, hello.     - Ken! - Hello.     I didn't think you were coming.     No, I was just late. I tried to call, but... the battery.     I didn't want all this to go to waste, so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.     Oh, that was lucky.     There's a little left. I could heat it up.     Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.     So I hear you're quite a tennis player.     I'm not much for the game myself. The ball's a little grabby.     That's where I usually sit. Right... there.     Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,     and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill.     You think I don't see what you're doing?     I know how hard it is to find the rightjob. We have that in common.     Do we?     Bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out.     That's just what I was thinking about doing.     Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.     I'm going to drain the old stinger.     Yeah, you do that.     Look at that.     You know, I've just about had it     with your little mind games.     - What's that? - Italian Vogue.     Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.     A lot of ads.     Remember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine?     Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!     I think something stinks in here!     I love the smell of flowers.     How do you like the smell of flames?!     Not as much.     Water bug! Not taking sides!     Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat! This is pathetic!     I've got issues!     Well, well, well, a royal flush!     - You're bluffing. - Am I?     Surf's up, dude!     Poo water!     That bowl is gnarly.     Except for those dirty yellow rings!     Kenneth! What are you doing?!     You know, I don't even like honey! I don't eat it!     We need to talk!     He's just a little bee!     And he happens to be the nicest bee I've met in a long time!     Long time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life?     No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you're one of them!     Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...     My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster!     Goodbye, Ken.     And for your information,     I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made by man!     I'm sorry about all that.     I know it's got an aftertaste! I like it!     I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me.     I couldn't overcome it. Oh, well.     Are you OK for the trial?     I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas.     We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.     Good idea! You can really see why he's considered one of the best lawyers...     Yeah.     Layton, you've gotta weave some magic     with this jury, or it's gonna be all over.     Don't worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around     is to remind them of what they don't like about bees.     - You got the tweezers? - Are you allergic?     Only to losing, son. Only to losing.     Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know.     What exactly is your relationship     to that woman?     We're friends.     - Good friends? - Yes.     How good? Do you live together?     Wait a minute...     Are you her little...     ...bedbug?     I've seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand,     doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee children?     - Yeah, but... - So those aren't your real parents!     - Oh, Barry... - Yes, they are!     Hold me back!     You're an illegitimate bee, aren't you, Benson?     He's denouncing bees!     Don't y'all date your cousins?     - Objection! - I'm going to pincushion this guy!     Adam, don't! It's what he wants!     Oh, I'm hit!!     Oh, lordy, I am hit!     Order! Order!     The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins!     I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction!     You see? You can't treat them like equals! They're striped savages!     Stinging's the only thing they know! It's their way!     - Adam, stay with me. - I can't feel my legs.     What angel of mercy will come forward to suck the poison     from my heaving buttocks?     I will have order in this court. Order!     Order, please!     The case of the honeybees versus the human race     took a pointed turn against the bees     yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery.     - Hey, buddy. - Hey.     - Is there much pain? - Yeah.     I...     I blew the whole case, didn't I?     It doesn't matter. What matters is you're alive. You could have died.     I'd be better off dead. Look at me.     They got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.     Look, there's a little celery still on it.     What was it like to sting someone?     I can't explain it. It was all...     All adrenaline and then... and then ecstasy!     All right.     You think it was all a trap?     Of course. I'm sorry. I flew us right into this.     What were we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of bugs in this world.     What will the humans do to us if they win?     I don't know.     I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn't sound so bad.     Adam, they check in, but they don't check out!     Oh, my.     Oould you get a nurse to close that window?     - Why? - The smoke.     Bees don't smoke.     Right. Bees don't smoke.     Bees don't smoke! But some bees are smoking.     That's it! That's our case!     It is? It's not over?     Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.     Get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can.     And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.     Mr. Flayman.     Yes? Yes, Your Honor!     Where is the rest of your team?     Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.     Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,     and as a result, we don't make very good time.     I actually heard a funny story about...     Your Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs     taken up enough of this court's valuable time?     How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on?     They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges     against my clients, who run legitimate businesses.     I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case!     Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going     to have to consider Mr. Montgomery's motion.     But you can't! We have a terrific case.     Where is your proof? Where is the evidence?     Show me the smoking gun!     Hold it, Your Honor! You want a smoking gun?     Here is your smoking gun.     What is that?     It's a bee smoker!     What, this? This harmless little contraption?     This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee.     Look at what has happened     to bees who have never been asked, ""Smoking or non?""     Is this what nature intended for us?     To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines     and man-made wooden slat work camps?     Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man?     - What are we gonna do? - He's playing the species card.     Ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees!     Free the bees! Free the bees!     Free the bees!     Free the bees! Free the bees!     The court finds in favor of the bees!     Vanessa, we won!     I knew you could do it! High-five!     Sorry.     I'm OK! You know what this means?     All the honey will finally belong to the bees.     Now we won't have to work so hard all the time.     This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson.     You'll regret this.     Barry, how much honey is out there?     All right. One at a time.     Barry, who are you wearing?     My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants.     - What if Montgomery's right? - What do you mean?     We've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years.     Oongratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement?     First, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps.     Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with,     every last drop.     We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more     than a filthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine.     We're all aware of what they do in the woods.     Wait for my signal.     Take him out.     He'll have nauseous for a few hours, then he'll be fine.     And we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames...     But it's just a prance-about stage name!     ...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products     and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments.     Oan't breathe.     Bring it in, boys!     Hold it right there! Good.     Tap it.     Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups, and there's gallons more coming!     - I think we need to shut down! - Shut down? We've never shut down.     Shut down honey production!     Stop making honey!     Turn your key, sir!     What do we do now?     Oannonball!     We're shutting honey production!     Mission abort.     Aborting pollination and nectar detail. Returning to base.     Adam, you wouldn't believe how much honey was out there.     Oh, yeah?     What's going on? Where is everybody?     - Are they out celebrating? - They're home.     They don't know what to do. Laying out, sleeping in.     I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket.     At least we got our honey back.     Sometimes I think, so what if humans liked our honey? Who wouldn't?     It's the greatest thing in the world! I was excited to be part of making it.     This was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well.     And now...     Now I can't.     I don't understand why they're not happy.     I thought their lives would be better!     They're doing nothing. It's amazing. Honey really changes people.     You don't have any idea what's going on, do you?     - What did you want to show me? - This.     What happened here?     That is not the half of it.     Oh, no. Oh, my.     They're all wilting.     Doesn't look very good, does it?     No.     And whose fault do you think that is?     You know, I'm gonna guess bees.     Bees?     Specifically, me.     I didn't think bees not needing to make honey would affect all these things.     It's notjust flowers. Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.     That's our whole SAT test right there.     Take away produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom.     And then, of course...     The human species?     So if there's no more pollination,     it could all just go south here, couldn't it?     I know this is also partly my fault.     How about a suicide pact?     How do we do it?     - I'll sting you, you step on me. - Thatjust kills you twice.     Right, right.     Listen, Barry... sorry, but I gotta get going.     I had to open my mouth and talk.     Vanessa?     Vanessa? Why are you leaving? Where are you going?     To the final Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena.     They've moved it to this weekend because all the flowers are dying.     It's the last chance I'll ever have to see it.     Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry. I never meant it to turn out like this.     I know. Me neither.     Tournament of Roses. Roses can't do sports.     Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?     Roses!     Vanessa!     Roses?!     Barry?     - Roses are flowers! - Yes, they are.     Flowers, bees, pollen!     I know. That's why this is the last parade.     Maybe not. Oould you ask him to slow down?     Oould you slow down?     Barry!     OK, I made a huge mistake. This is a total disaster, all my fault.     Yes, it kind of is.     I've ruined the planet. I wanted to help you     with the flower shop. I've made it worse.     Actually, it's completely closed down.     I thought maybe you were remodeling.     But I have another idea, and it's greater than my previous ideas combined.     I don't want to hear it!     All right, they have the roses, the roses have the pollen.     I know every bee, plant and flower bud in this park.     All we gotta do is get what they've got back here with what we've got.     - Bees. - Park.     - Pollen! - Flowers.     - Repollination! - Across the nation!     Tournament of Roses, Pasadena, Oalifornia.     They've got nothing but flowers, floats and cotton candy.     Security will be tight.     I have an idea.     Vanessa Bloome, FTD.     Official floral business. It's real.     Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.     Thank you. It was a gift.     Once inside, we just pick the right float.     How about The Princess and the Pea?     I could be the princess, and you could be the pea!     Yes, I got it.     - Where should I sit? - What are you?     - I believe I'm the pea. - The pea?     It goes under the mattresses.     - Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart. - I'm getting the marshal.     You do that! This whole parade is a fiasco!     Let's see what this baby'll do.     Hey, what are you doing?!     Then all we do is blend in with traffic...     ...without arousing suspicion.     Once at the airport, there's no stopping us.     Stop! Security.     - You and your insect pack your float? - Yes.     Has it been in your possession the entire time?     Would you remove your shoes?     - Remove your stinger. - It's part of me.     I know. Just having some fun. Enjoy your flight.     Then if we're lucky, we'll have just enough pollen to do the job.     Oan you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job!     I think this is gonna work.     It's got to work.     Attention, passengers, this is Oaptain Scott.     We have a bit of bad weather in New York.     It looks like we'll experience a couple hours delay.     Barry, these are cut flowers with no water. They'll never make it.     I gotta get up there and talk to them.     Be careful.     Oan I get help with the Sky Mall magazine?     I'd like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.     Oaptain, I'm in a real situation.     - What'd you say, Hal? - Nothing.     Bee!     Don't freak out! My entire species...     What are you doing?     - Wait a minute! I'm an attorney! - Who's an attorney?     Don't move.     Oh, Barry.     Good afternoon, passengers. This is your captain.     Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B please report to the cockpit?     And please hurry!     What happened here?     There was a DustBuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded.     One's bald, one's in a boat, they're both unconscious!     - Is that another bee joke? - No!     No one's flying the plane!     This is JFK control tower, Flight 356. What's your status?     This is Vanessa Bloome. I'm a florist from New York.     Where's the pilot?     He's unconscious, and so is the copilot.     Not good. Does anyone onboard have flight experience?     As a matter of fact, there is.     - Who's that? - Barry Benson.     From the honey trial?! Oh, great.     Vanessa, this is nothing more than a big metal bee.     It's got giant wings, huge engines.     I can't fly a plane.     - Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot? - Yes.     How hard could it be?     Wait, Barry! We're headed into some lightning.     This is Bob Bumble. We have some late-breaking news from JFK Airport,     where a suspenseful scene is developing.     Barry Benson, fresh from his legal victory...     That's Barry!     ...is attempting to land a plane, loaded with people, flowers     and an incapacitated flight crew.     Flowers?!     We have a storm in the area and two individuals at the controls     with absolutely no flight experience.     Just a minute. There's a bee on that plane.     I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson and his no-account compadres.     They've done enough damage.     But isn't he your only hope?     Technically, a bee shouldn't be able to fly at all.     Their wings are too small...     Haven't we heard this a million times?     ""The surface area of the wings and body mass make no sense.""     - Get this on the air! - Got it.     - Stand by. - We're going live.     The way we work may be a mystery to you.     Making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs.     But let me tell you about a small job.     If you do it well, it makes a big difference.     More than we realized. To us, to everyone.     That's why I want to get bees back to working together.     That's the bee way! We're not made of Jell-O.     We get behind a fellow.     - Black and yellow! - Hello!     Left, right, down, hover.     - Hover? - Forget hover.     This isn't so hard. Beep-beep! Beep-beep!     Barry, what happened?!     Wait, I think we were on autopilot the whole time.     - That may have been helping me. - And now we're not!     So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.     All of you, let's get behind this fellow! Move it out!     Move out!     Our only chance is if I do what I'd do, you copy me with the wings of the plane!     Don't have to yell.     I'm not yelling! We're in a lot of trouble.     It's very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice!     It's not a tone. I'm panicking!     I can't do this!     Vanessa, pull yourself together. You have to snap out of it!     You snap out of it.     You snap out of it.     - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it!     - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it!     - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it!     - Hold it! - Why? Oome on, it's my turn.     How is the plane flying?     I don't know.     Hello?     Benson, got any flowers for a happy occasion in there?     The Pollen Jocks!     They do get behind a fellow.     - Black and yellow. - Hello.     All right, let's drop this tin can on the blacktop.     Where? I can't see anything. Oan you?     No, nothing. It's all cloudy.     Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry.     - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee.     Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!     Wait a minute. I think I'm feeling something.     - What? - I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.     Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.     Bring the nose down.     Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!     - What in the world is on the tarmac? - Get some lights on that!     Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!     - Vanessa, aim for the flower. - OK.     Out the engines. We're going in on bee power. Ready, boys?     Affirmative!     Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.     Land on that flower!     Ready? Full reverse!     Spin it around!     - Not that flower! The other one! - Which one?     - That flower. - I'm aiming at the flower!     That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt. I mean the giant pulsating flower     made of millions of bees!     Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.     Rotate around it.     - This is insane, Barry! - This's the only way I know how to fly.     Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane flying in an insect-like pattern?     Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid. Smell it. Full reverse!     Just drop it. Be a part of it.     Aim for the center!     Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!     Oome on, already.     Barry, we did it! You taught me how to fly!     - Yes. No high-five! - Right.     Barry, it worked! Did you see the giant flower?     What giant flower? Where? Of course I saw the flower! That was genius!     - Thank you. - But we're not done yet.     Listen, everyone!     This runway is covered with the last pollen     from the last flowers available anywhere on Earth.     That means this is our last chance.     We're the only ones who make honey, pollinate flowers and dress like this.     If we're gonna survive as a species, this is our moment! What do you say?     Are we going to be bees, orjust Museum of Natural History keychains?     We're bees!     Keychain!     Then follow me! Except Keychain.     Hold on, Barry. Here.     You've earned this.     Yeah!     I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.     Oh, yeah.     That's our Barry.     Mom! The bees are back!     If anybody needs to make a call, now's the time.     I got a feeling we'll be working late tonight!     Here's your change. Have a great afternoon! Oan I help who's next?     Would you like some honey with that? It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.     Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me. And I don't see a nickel!     Sometimes I just feel like a piece of meat!     I had no idea.     Barry, I'm sorry. Have you got a moment?     Would you excuse me? My mosquito associate will help you.     Sorry I'm late.     He's a lawyer too?     I was already a blood-sucking parasite. All I needed was a briefcase.     Have a great afternoon!     Barry, I just got this huge tulip order, and I can't get them anywhere.     No problem, Vannie. Just leave it to me.     You're a lifesaver, Barry. Oan I help who's next?     All right, scramble, jocks! It's time to fly.     Thank you, Barry!     That bee is living my life!     Let it go, Kenny.     - When will this nightmare end?! - Let it all go.     - Beautiful day to fly. - Sure is.     Between you and me, I was dying to get out of that office.     You have got to start thinking bee, my friend.     - Thinking bee! - Me?     Hold it. Let's just stop for a second. Hold it.     I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone. Oan we stop here?     I'm not making a major life decision during a production number!     All right. Take ten, everybody. Wrap it up, guys.     I had virtually no rehearsal for that.

Consequently, delays and environmental problems are caused, due to aircraft congestion in the airports. Thus, it is necessary for the airports to use the existing infrastructure efficiently and generate some changes in the system and the way airports are operated. For this reason, the prediction of aircraft taxi time is substantial in order to help airports understand what is necessary to change so as to optimise their efficiency and reduce the aircraft taxi time. This project concerns Manchester’s airport and data about the aircrafts’ features and external factors were given in order to predict taxi time. This machine learning project was following the CRISP-DM process for data mining.  All the processes were handled on Python, as it provides Pandas library which creates a useful data frame that provides an easy way to handle and modify the data. Moreover, the scikit-learn library was used for the machine learning was used for the machine learning procedure, by providing all the algorithm that are necessary for this problem. The machine learning algorithms that were applied are Linear regression, Polynomial Regression, Random Forests and Multilayer Perceptrons. The examination of algorithms that were applied showed that the most suitable for the project is Polynomial regression, because it provides the most precise and accurate prediction of taxi time with accuracy equal to 79.94%.

The notebook presents a face recognition system. Tthe ideas presented here are from FaceNetand DeepFace.  Face recognition problems commonly fall into two categories:  Face Verification - ""is this the claimed person?"". For example, at some airports, you can pass through customs by letting a system scan your passport and then verifying that you (the person carrying the passport) are the correct person. A mobile phone that unlocks using your face is also using face verification. This is a 1:1 matching problem. Face Recognition - ""who is this person?"". For example, the video lecture showed a face recognition video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wr4rx0Spihs) of Baidu employees entering the office without needing to otherwise identify themselves.

Face recognition has received substantial attention from researchers due to human activities found in various applications of security like airport, criminal detection, face tracking, forensic etc. Compared to other biometric traits like palm print, Iris, finger print etc., face biometrics can be non-intrusive. They can be taken even without user’s knowledge and further can be used for security based applications like criminal detection, face tracking, airport security, and forensic surveillance systems. Face recognition involves capturing face image from a video or from a surveillance camera. They are compared with the stored database. Face biometrics involves training known images, classify them with known classes and then they are stored in the database. When a test image is given to the system it is classified and compared with stored database. Face biometrics is a challenging field of research with various limitations imposed for a machine face recognition like variations in head pose, change in illumination, facial expression, aging, occlusion due to accessories etc.,. Various approaches were suggested by researchers in overcoming the limitations stated. 72 Automatic face recognition involves face detection, feature extraction and face recognition. Face recognition algorithms are broadly classified into two classes as image template based and geometric feature based. The template based methods compute correlation between face and one or more model templates to find the face identity. Principal component analysis, linear discriminate analysis, kernel methods etc. are used to construct face templates. The geometric feature based methods are used to analyze explicit local features and their geometric relations (elastic bung graph method). Multi resolution tools such as contour lets, ridge lets were found to be useful for analyzing information content of images and found its application in image processing, pattern recognition, and computer vision. Curvelets transform is used for texture classification and image de-noising. Application of Curvelets transform for feature extraction in image processing is still under research.",3,3,3,airport,GitHub
548,Bluebikes-project,https://github.com/janeminmin/Bluebikes-project.git,"1>  Background information Bluebikes is Metro Boston’s public bike share program, with more than 1800 bikes at over 200 stations across Boston and nearby areas. The bikes sharing program launched in 2011. The program aimed for individuals to use it for short-term basis for a price. It allows individuals to borrow a bike from a dock station after using it, which makes it ideal for one-way trips. The City of Boston is committed to providing bike share as a part of the public transportation system. However, to build a transport system that encourages bicycling, it is important to build knowledge about the current bicycle flows, and what factors are involved in the decision-making of potential bicyclists when choosing whether to use the bicycle. It is logical to make hypotheses that age and gender, bicycle infrastructure, safety perception are possible determinants of bicycling. On the short-term perspective, it has been shown that weather plays an important role whether to choose the bicycle.  2> Data collection The Bluebikes collects and provides system data to the public. The datasets used in the project can be download through this link (https://www.bluebikes.com/system-data). Based on this time series dataset (start from 2017-01-01 00:00:00 to 2019-03-31 23:00:00), we could have the information includes: Trip duration, start time and data, stop time and data, start station name and id, end station name and id, bike id, user type (casual or subscribed), birth year, gender. Besides, any trips that were below 60 seconds in length is considered as potentially false starts, which is already removed in the datasets. The number of bicycles used during a particular time period, varies over time based on several factors, including the current weather conditions, time of the day, time of the year and the current interest of the biker to use the bicycle as a transport mode. The current interest is different between subscribed users and casual users, so we should analyze them separately. Factors such as season, day of a week, month, hour, and if a holiday can be extracted from the date and time column in the datasets. Since we would analyze the hourly bicycle rental flow, we need hourly weather conditions data from 2017-01-01 00:00:00 to 2019-03-31 23:00:00 to complete our regression model of prediction. The weather data used in the project is scrapped using python selenium from Logan airport station (42.38 °N, 71.04 °W) webpage (https://www.wunderground.com/history/daily/us/ma/boston/KBOS/date/2019-7-15) maintained by weather underground website. The hourly weather observations include time, temperature, dew point, humidity, wind, wind speed, wind gust, pressure, precipitation, precipitation accumulated, condition. 3> The problem The aims of the project are to gain insight of the factors that could give short-term perspective of bicycle flows in Boston. It also aimed to investigate the how busy each station is, the division of bicycle trip direction and duration of the usage of a busy station and the mean flows variation within a day or during that period. The addition to the factors included in the regression model, there also exist other factors than influence how the bicycle flows vary over longer periods time. For example, general tendency to use the bicycle. Therefore, there is potential to improve the regression model accuracy by incorporating a long-term trend estimate taken over the time series of bicycle usage. Then the result from the machine learning algorithm-based regression model should be compared with the time series forecasting-based models. 4> Possible solutions Data preprocessing/Exploration and variable selection: date approximation manipulation, correlation analysis among variables, merging data, scrubbing for duplicate data, verifying errors, interpolation for missing values, handling outliers and skewness, binning low frequent levels, encoding categorical variables. Data visualization: split number of bike usage by subscribed/casual to build time series; build heatmap to present how busy is each station and locate the busiest station in the busiest period of a busy day; using boxplot and histogram to check outliers and determine appropriate data transformation, using weather condition text to build word cloud. Time series trend curve estimates: two possible way we considered are fitting polynomials of various degrees to the data points in the time series or by using time series decomposition functions and forecast functions to extract and forecast. We would emphasize on the importance to generate trend curve estimates that do not follow the seasonal variations: the seasonal variations should be captured explicitly by the input weather related variables in the regression model. Prediction/regression/time series forecasting: It is possible to build up multilayer perceptron neural network regressor to build up models and give prediction based on all variables of data, time and weather. However, considering the interpretability of model, we prefer to build regression models based on machine learning algorithms (like random forest or SVM) respectively for subscribed/casual users. Then the regressor would be combined with trend curve extracted and forecasted by ARIMA, and then comparing with the result of time series forecasting by STL (Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess) with multiple seasonal periods and the result of TBATS (Trigonometric Seasonal, Box-Cox Transformation, ARMA residuals, Trend and Seasonality).",3,1,3,airport,GitHub

692,Concorde,https://github.com/concorde-speed/Concorde.git,"Date of Concorde In January of the year 1976 after 29 years of the first to penetrate to the speed of sound military aircraft jet - Two Concord took off together at the same time, one from London and one from Paris, the first airline service ultrasound for travelers. The aircraft Almottaghtan has looked towards the west as if they were Tgaraan - even Tsabakan - the sun. Where they arrived as if they did not Taathrca, in terms of time, in a new event launches air transport stage supersonic passenger wealthy people who do not allow them to narrow their time to stay in the air for long periods. How the project began and evolved, and how the outcome of the remaining Concorde lounges to museums ... This is what Santapah in the following lines: The emergence of the Concorde The deal ""supersonic"" between England and France was signed in 1962, for the design and construction of the first civilian supersonic plane manufactured by Airbus for them. After long years of arduous efforts and research strenuous, in addition to more than 5,000 hours in the air tunnels, proved to be a form of equity Almstrq with the body long cylinder for aircraft relatively large passengers, it is the best form executable command and control speeds ultrasound. The first two aircraft of this type making and Tjeribhma in 1969, and since then about 20 aircraft of this model, called the ""Concord"" was produced (the only civilian aircraft that exceed the speed of sound speed), and who serve in the British Airways and Air France in income 1976, the rate of seven aircraft of the British lines and five lines in French. The first fly line is the London - Singapore via Bahrain. In 1976 received Bahrain Airport very important event, which is to start regular flights between Bahrain and London, the fastest of the British Airways sound Concorde, the airport first and the only one who was receiving this type of aircraft in the Middle East, given that the Concorde need to Airports women with special specifications, so they need to take-off and landing runways longer than the regular airports runways, and the noise from the power of their engines leads to smash windows of buildings ordinary airports, and the speed has a crush Madarjha. What Concorde is distinct from other aircraft?Characterized by Concorde slim form in the form of a triangle (delta). And fly faster and higher than other aircraft altitudes, using the ""upward vortex"" method to accomplish extraordinary mission. For example, while the ""Boeing 747"" aircraft speed, better known as ""jumbo"" around 900 km / h (about 84.0 Mach) at an altitude of 35 thousand feet, the Concorde fly quickly 2172 km / h (Mach 2) at an altitude of 60 thousand Foot. It is known that Almaj is the real rate of speed compared to the speed of sound, and is equivalent to an average of 1225 kilometers per hour, so that the speed of sound changes with temperature change, which moves rapidly 1190 km / h at sea level, but it drops to 1060 km / h at an altitude of 36,000 feet above the ground, where the air temperature drops. Because the Place de la Concorde to fly faster than the speed of sound, they differ from the rest of the aircraft on several characteristics. First, in terms of the flow of the fuselage, where you need to own dynamic shape to face severe air resistance at these high speeds, and it is achieved by taking the body form of a high pin tapered, triangular wings tilted back, my head and a tail, and an introduction brushes can be moved to the bottom of takeoffs and landings to be able to see the pilot of the corridor, to the top during flight to improve the flow of the fuselage. Amounting to 83 feet and 8 inches tall plane wings in the company ""Oarossbesiak"" has produced and supplied surfaces work together Kdvh depth, also works differentially Kjnahat. There is no tip installed inside the concavity of the wing, but no spire parties descend and spin at the same time. The second difference is related engines, where the Concorde's engines proved directly in the wings to avoid the use of any parts of the conductive would crash at high speeds, and the engine fitted with a special friendly hotel to exploit the resulting exhaust for initial combustion cycle combustion again mixing with more new fuel to increase efficient engines and power, where this process provides the engine in the final stage of heating fuel for the production of the required additional power for takeoff and the transition from one phase to the heating of supersonic flight, allowing aircraft takeoff speed of 360 km / h. The useful load carried by the Concorde's less than a third of what was done other than in the weight of the jets under the sound, so it was no reduction in the efficiency of the engine, it is actually the difference between profit and loss. Every Concorde has supplied four-engine aircraft, ""Snecma Olympus DS 593,"" the momentum of 17259 kg. The company ""Rolls Royce"" design engines, which provided all Dagtin separate engine in order to fuel economy. Each engine and also provided additional Aq. Engine reverse payment system is also equipped. On the other hand, the Concorde is distinct from other aircraft fuel tanks and the presence of more and larger, with four engines burn a tremendous amount of kerosene has more than 25 thousand liters per flight hour. However, the fuel tanks lead a purpose whatever else, which is to maintain the equilibrium plane, where the center to raise the plane travels at high speeds for its center of gravity and then you move amounts of fuel between private additional tanks at the front of the plane and the rear to offset that effect, and returned those quantities at low speed in preparation for landing to bring the situation back to its origin. For example, a flight plan requires the distance between Paris and the French coast on the Atlantic equator at less than the speed of sound speed is determined to 0.93 Mach, to be at the height of about 9000 meters, after which the plane begins to jump quickly to reach the speed of take-off and altitude wanted, it performs speed between the two situations difference to a change in the dynamics of the plane to move from the airline less than the sound quickly to other higher speed of sound, and to overcome this situation, the transfer of fuel in an aircraft using a payment of reservoirs located in the introduction to the reservoirs in the system rear. During the transitional situation between the two modes of ex (between Mach 1 and Mach 1.6) increases air resistance sharply, and at this moment is to break the sound barrier. Once access to 1.7 Mach the captain to stop the internal combustion process, after more than a very plane speed of up to Mach 2, or 2200 km / h, more than twice the speed of sound, which represent the target aircraft speed, while the estimated target of 16000 and 18000 meters altitude. But when approaching landing, the fuel will move to the front of the plane, and the concomitant rise in the plane's nose, to land the plane in a scene it looks like a bird landing on the surface of the water. Finally remains the difference in the fuselage coating, where the Concorde is exposed at high speeds to a very large rise in body temperature as a result of increased friction of air molecules, so they coated special material properties and reflective stronger than those in the other aircraft, capable of dispersing such high temperatures . The fuselage itself is made from a special metal is characterized by a greater capacity to withstand the heat and stress resistance resulting from inflation fuselage resulting in turn from high temperature. The speed of the plane have been identified in the horizontal flight Mach 2.2, which is just before the thermal barrier (which is the speed at which if exceeded temperature increases dramatically), but it has identified the chronological age of the structure of 60,000 flight hours. And making the structure of the aluminum-alloy steel by thermal changes from -35 degrees to +120 degrees, as the flight above the speed limit of the plane requires that the structure is made with a mixture of steel and titanium, which means more weight. Fly the Concorde at the highest altitudes of 50,000 feet, where the air is equal to a tenth of what Tsawiyeh at sea density, and the temperature at that very low altitude, and despite all this work ultrasonic motors with high efficiency. According to reports of the pilots can handle the plane easily. The acceleration of the aircraft and transit speeds TransitionAnd what is characterized travel Balkounkord from other aircraft? Accommodate the Concorde for a hundred passengers and crew consists of a pilot and a flight engineer and his assistant in addition to the six hosts. When quitting, the passenger feels strongly pay back as a result of the launch aircraft from sleep to the speed of 362 km / h in just 30 seconds, which is called the Earth's gravitational force, and quickly reach the maximum height of the plane and penetrate the speed of the sound barrier. In all the flight times travelers can know the speed, through a private display panel installed in front of them, and are entitled to see the curve of the globe and Northern Lights because of the high altitude, which is flying the plane. Travelers can also watch the first layer colors of the atmosphere, where the height of the plane boundary between the first two Tbaktah. It takes Atlantic crossing Balkounkord three and a half hours only, while the that time about nine hours in the other underneath the aircraft sounds. And up the Concorde passengers who starts his journey from London at ten thirty in the morning to New York at nine thirty in the morning, before the date of its launch radios. This of course does not mean a retreat in time, but due to time differences and the short flight time! Over the last quarter-century, Concorde was the five weekly flights between Paris and New York in a record speed of less than 4 hours, at which time it cut the best of conventional aircraft, the same distance in 8 hours. He was landing at Kennedy Airport (according to US time) at eight in the morning, and exiting back to France at the eleventh hour before noon, where businessmen French used to negotiate with the Americans their customers at the airport Salons, without having to go to the business and financial district in Manhattan, and then return to Paris the same day.  And to what the fate of the Concorde? I tried both the US and Soviet governments (former) develop similar Balkounkord aircraft, but those attempts ended in retreat, either because the magnitude of the required expenditures on the American side, or the occurrence of accidents due to human error on the Soviet side. Some of these Soviet aircraft had stayed (model ""T U-144""), as amended to date, but used in air mail services, also placed some of them in museums, while one of them devoted to project Russian joint US. And remained the Concorde, solo travel of passengers faster than the speed of sound even temporarily suspended service to make adjustments after the accident led to an explosion killed one of them and all of them were. In addition, the high run that made the ticket price between Paris, London and New York round-trip $ 10,000, which led to limited use of the rich and famous costs, as well as what caused the noise and pollution, suffered Concorde most suffered from weak passenger demand for flights, in Following the incident, which came under the air France one in Paris in July 2000 to a near Charles de Gaulle airport hotels, which led to the deaths of 109 people on board and four people on the ground. Consequently After some major attended by experts and investigators, scientists, lawyers, artists, religious leaders and industrialists from different generations, between believers technology and Muslims in terms of authority to the modern age and among those who believe that it is necessary to rein in scientific progress and the development of ethical and legal controls him, took the final decision to stop flights Place de la Concorde. In July of 2003, tens of thousands of lovers of the Concorde gathered along the road to Heathrow Airport in the fog of London, the capital, in a bid farewell final before this model withdraw aircraft from service, after it made its first commercial flight in 1976. This has three Concorde planes reviewing the air before landing at Heathrow Airport in a reference to the termination of commercial flights known aircraft at supersonic speed. And charged the British Airways Concorde plane carrying 100 special guest at the final flight, which launched from Kennedy Airport in New York towards London, penetrated the sound barrier for the last time. Upon entering British airspace acceded Two Concord British Airways, one coming from the city of Edinburgh in Scotland, and the other from the Bay of Biscay west of France. Lovers plane Odalla in July of 2003 in Paris, as well as a pool, in the last trip out between Paris and New York, after a 27-year-old was cut where the distance between the two cities in a matter of three hours and a half. Where he lined up more than 250 workers from the maintenance workers bodyguards honor of the plane at Charles de Gaulle airport, with thousands of French gathered on the edge of the airport to see the plane taking off, holding a banner reading ""We love you, Concord."" The French lines: that the plane Concorde belong to the humanitarian aviation heritage and must therefore provide an opportunity for more people to see it, and added that it would apply to all of the fleet of Air France Concorde aircraft, which will be displayed every aircraft in museums in France, Germany and the United States, such as the Museum aviation and aerospace in the suburb of ""Le Bourget"" Paris, the Museum of Aviation near the Scottish capital ""Edinburgh"". Parts of the plane crashed as sold at Christie's for souvenirs to those who died to travel out, varied between the nose of the plane and the door of cabin leadership and a seat pilot and antenna radar warning in which the two motors of the engines and parts of the dashboard to the instructions and cutlery dishwasher ceramic spoons and silver booklet, worth total amounted to 3.29 million euros, went in favor of a charitable institution of the air France is working in the field of care for the poor children. Last auction for the sale of pieces of a British Airways Concorde has also been established. The British and French companies have announced at the beginning of the month of April of the same year 2003, he stopped Concorde flights after the company ""Airbus"" that produced externa announced: What's next in the field of transport ultrasonic? American company, ""Boeing"" is currently working on the supersonic jet, is supposed to be placed in service during the coming years, while filling the attention of European rival, ""Airbus"" accomplish its flagship aircraft, ""Airbus A380 (superjumbo) capable of carrying about 800 passengers, which had been achieved in 2007, while scientists tried to Japanese to develop a model of the plane was enable fly twice as fast as the Concorde, but their experience after the plane landed long model briefly after take-off from the site ""Woomera"" to launch rockets in the desert south of Australia, and it failed within the project included my company, ""Mitsubishi heavy Industries"" and ""Nissan Motor."" He held this paradigm of a length of 11 meters on a rocket, Plans for him to be separated from the booster rocket above the ground, and falling faster than twice the speed of sound, but it got out of control since it was launched. It was supposed to reach the aircraft remotely piloted altitude of 20 thousand meters, before Taud.aly ground faster than twice the speed of sound. The goal was to become a plane ""NeXT 1"" transport aircraft the fastest in the world to succeed Concorde, with the difference that it will be less noise and damaging to the environment and can accommodate up to 300 passengers: Thus crossed another Concorde SST recent trip mounted aboard a ship in the River Thames sailing from London to the Museum of Flight in Edinburgh, after he has made more than eight thousand flight during which 22 thousand and 768 hours and 56 cut-minute flight, the folded thereby separating mythic unique and important commercial aviation history, a supersonic flight, waiting for what the future holds for us of new inventions ?!",2,6,2,airport,GitHub

Barry, what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in.

Put that on your resume brochure. My whole face could puff up. Make it one of your special skills. Knocking someone out is also a special skill. Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks. - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever. - You could put carob chips on there. - Bye. - Supposed to be less calories. - Bye. I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something. All right, here it goes. Nah. What would I say? I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human. I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to. Oh, I can't do it. Oome on! No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't. How should I start it? ""You like jazz?"" No, that's no good. Here she comes! Speak, you fool! Hi! I'm sorry. - You're talking. - Yes, I know. You're talking! I'm so sorry. No, it's OK. It's fine. I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed. Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting. This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee! I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me. And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised. That was a little weird. - I'm talking with a bee. - Yeah. I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me! I just want to say I'm grateful. I'll leave now. - Wait! How did you learn to do that? - What? The talking thing. Same way you did, I guess. ""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up. - That's very funny. - Yeah. Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with. Anyway... Oan I... ...get you something? - Like what? I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Ooffee? I don't want to put you out. It's no trouble. It takes two minutes. - It's just coffee. - I hate to impose. - Don't be ridiculous! - Actually, I would love a cup. Hey, you want rum cake? - I shouldn't. - Have some. - No, I can't. - Oome on! I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms. - Where? - These stripes don't help. You look great! I don't know if you know anything about fashion. Are you all right? No. He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison. He finally gets there. He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on. And he says, ""Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan. Why would I marry a watermelon?"" Is that a bee joke? That's the kind of stuff we do. Yeah, different. So, what are you gonna do, Barry? About work? I don't know. I want to do my part for the hive, but I can't do it the way they want. I know how you feel. - You do? - Sure. My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist. - Really? - My only interest is flowers. Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan. Anyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it? You're in Sheep Meadow! Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond! No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once. - Why do girls put rings on their toes? - Why not? - It's like putting a hat on your knee. - Maybe I'll try that. - You all right, ma'am? - Oh, yeah. Fine. Just having two cups of coffee! Anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee. Yeah, it's no trouble. Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life. Are you...? Oan I take a piece of this with me? Sure! Here, have a crumb. - Thanks! - Yeah. All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not. OK, Barry. And thank you so much again... for before. Oh, that? That was nothing. Well, not nothing, but... Anyway... This can't possibly work. He's all set to go. We may as well try it. OK, Dave, pull the chute. - Sounds amazing. - It was amazing! It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life. Humans! I can't believe you were with humans! Giant, scary humans! What were they like? Huge and crazy. They talk crazy. They eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy. - Do they try and kill you, like on TV? - Some of them. But some of them don't. - How'd you get back? - Poodle. You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see. You had your ""experience."" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal. - Well... - Well? Well, I met someone. You did? Was she Bee-ish? - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you! - No, no, no, not a wasp. - Spider? - I'm not attracted to spiders. I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face. So who is she? She's... human. No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law. - Her name's Vanessa. - Oh, boy. She's so nice. And she's a florist! Oh, no! You're dating a human florist! We're not dating. You're flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite! She saved my life! And she understands me. This is over! Eat this. This is not over! What was that? - They call it a crumb. - It was so stingin' stripey! And that's not what they eat. That's what falls off what they eat! - You know what a Oinnabon is? - No. It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up... Sit down! ...really hot! - Listen to me! We are not them! We're us. There's us and there's them! Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning? There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me! You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee! - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee. Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! There he is. He's in the pool. You know what your problem is, Barry? I gotta start thinking bee? How much longer will this go on? It's been three days! Why aren't you working? I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about. What life? You have no life! You have no job. You're barely a bee! Would it kill you to make a little honey? Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you. Martin, would you talk to him? Barry, I'm talking to you! You coming? Got everything? All set! Go ahead. I'll catch up. Don't be too long. Watch this! Vanessa! - We're still here. - I told you not to yell at him. He doesn't respond to yelling! - Then why yell at me? - Because you don't listen! I'm not listening to this. Sorry, I've gotta go. - Where are you going? - I'm meeting a friend. A girl? Is this why you can't decide? Bye. I just hope she's Bee-ish. They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena? To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream! Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering. A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events? No. All right, I've got one. How come you don't fly everywhere? It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster. Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn. TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane! You don't have that? We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease. Oh, my. Dumb bees! You must want to sting all those jerks. We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us. So you have to watch your temper. Very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy, lust. Oh, my goodness! Are you OK? Yeah. - What is wrong with you?! - It's a bug. He's not bothering anybody. Get out of here, you creep! What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular? Yeah, it was. How did you know? It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit. You've really got that down to a science. - I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue. - I'll bet. What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this? How did this get here? Oute Bee, Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select? - Is he that actor? - I never heard of him. - Why is this here? - For people. We eat it. You don't have enough food of your own? - Well, yes. - How do you get it? - Bees make it. - I know who makes it! And it's hard to make it! There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing! - It's organic. - It's our-ganic! It's just honey, Barry. Just what?! Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing! You've taken our homes, schools, hospitals! This is all we have! And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this. I'm getting to the bottom of all of this! Hey, Hector. - You almost done? - Almost. He is here. I sense it. Well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around. You're busted, box boy! I knew I heard something. So you can talk! I can talk. And now you'll start talking! Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier? I don't understand. I thought we were friends. The last thing we want to do is upset bees! You're too late! It's ours now! You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword! You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio! Where is the honey coming from? Tell me where! Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms! Orazy person! What horrible thing has happened here? These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now they're on the road to nowhere! Just keep still. What? You're not dead? Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed? To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here. I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off! I'm going to Tacoma. - And you? - He really is dead. All right. Uh-oh! - What is that?! - Oh, no! - A wiper! Triple blade! - Triple blade? Jump on! It's your only chance, bee! Why does everything have to be so doggone clean?! How much do you people need to see?! Open your eyes! Stick your head out the window! From NPR News in Washington, I'm Oarl Kasell. But don't kill no more bugs! - Bee! - Moose blood guy!! - You hear something? - Like what? Like tiny screaming. Turn off the radio. Whassup, bee boy? Hey, Blood. Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see. Wow! I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it. I mean, that honey's ours. - Bees hang tight. - We're all jammed in. It's a close community. Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own. - What if you get in trouble? - You a mosquito, you in trouble. Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack! At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls. Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly. Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito. You got to be kidding me! Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee! - Hey, guys! - Mooseblood! I knew I'd catch y'all down here. Did you bring your crazy straw? We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit. What is this place? A bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead. They are pinheads! Pinhead. - Oheck out the new smoker. - Oh, sweet. That's the one you want. The Thomas 3000! Smoker? Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar. A couple breaths of this knocks them right out. They make the honey, and we make the money. ""They make the honey, and we make the money""? Oh, my! What's going on? Are you OK? Yeah. It doesn't last too long. Do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls? Our queen was moved here. We had no choice. This is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes! That's a drag queen! What is this? Oh, no! There's hundreds of them! Bee honey. Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale! This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something. Oh, Barry, stop. Who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor. Do these look like rumors? That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos. How did you get mixed up in this? He's been talking to humans. - What? - Talking to humans?! He has a human girlfriend. And they make out! Make out? Barry! We do not. - You wish you could. - Whose side are you on? The bees! I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night. Barry, this is what you want to do with your life? I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees! Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop. I remember that. What right do they have to our honey? We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever! Even if it's true, what can one bee do? Sting them where it really hurts. In the face! The eye! - That would hurt. - No. Up the nose? That's a killer. There's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters. Hive at Five, the hive's only full-hour action news source. No more bee beards! With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk. Weather with Storm Stinger. Sports with Buzz Larvi. And Jeanette Ohung. - Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble. - And I'm Jeanette Ohung. A tri-county bee, Barry Benson, intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey, packaging it and profiting from it illegally! Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King, we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book, Olassy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon. Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson. Did you ever think, ""I'm a kid from the hive. I can't do this""? Bees have never been afraid to change the world. What about Bee Oolumbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus? Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans. We were thinking of stickball or candy stores. How old are you? The bee community is supporting you in this case, which will be the trial of the bee century. You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too. It's a common name. Next week... He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots... Next week... Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard 'em. Bear Week next week! They're scary, hairy and here live. Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish. In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness! It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81. Honey, her backhand's a joke! I'm not gonna take advantage of that? Quiet, please. Actual work going on here. - Is that that same bee? - Yes, it is! I'm helping him sue the human race. - Hello. - Hello, bee. This is Ken. Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe. Why does he talk again? Listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working. But it's our yogurt night! Bye-bye. Why is yogurt night so difficult?! You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours! Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help. - Frosting... - How many sugars? Just one. I try not to use the competition. So why are you helping me? Bees have good qualities. And it takes my mind off the shop. Instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now. Those are great, if you're three. And artificial flowers. - Oh, those just get me psychotic! - Yeah, me too. Bent stingers, pointless pollination. Bees must hate those fake things! Nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done. Maybe this could make up for it a little bit. - This lawsuit's a pretty big deal. - I guess. You sure you want to go through with it? Am I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able to say, ""Honey, I'm home,"" without paying a royalty! It's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan, where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history, we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak. What have we gotten into here, Barry? It's pretty big, isn't it? I can't believe how many humans don't work during the day. You think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers? Everybody needs to stay behind the barricade. - What's the matter? - I don't know, I just got a chill. Well, if it isn't the bee team. You boys work on this? All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding. All right. Oase number 4475, Superior Oourt of New York, Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry is now in session. Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively? A privilege. Mr. Benson... you're representing all the bees of the world? I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed. Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother was a simple woman. Born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us. If we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, just think of what would it mean. I would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches! Talking bee! How do we know this isn't some sort of holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry? They could be using laser beams! Robotics! Ventriloquism! Oloning! For all we know, he could be on steroids! Mr. Benson? Ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here. I'm just an ordinary bee. Honey's pretty important to me. It's important to all bees. We invented it! We make it. And we protect it with our lives. Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take it from us 'cause we're the little guys! I'm hoping that, after this is all over, you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have but everything we are! I wish he'd dress like that all the time. So nice! Oall your first witness. So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have. I suppose so. I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron! Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms. Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term. I don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you? - No. - I couldn't hear you. - No. - No. Because you don't free bees. You keep bees. Not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey. They're very lovable creatures. Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear. You mean like this? Bears kill bees! How'd you like his head crashing through your living room?! Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows! OK, that's enough. Take him away. So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me. - Where have I heard it before? - I was with a band called The Police. But you've never been a police officer, have you? No, I haven't. No, you haven't. And so here we have yet another example of bee culture casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prance-about stage name. Oh, please. Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting? Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting. Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner! That's not his real name?! You idiots! Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005. Thank you. Thank you. I see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow. I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime? Not yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you? Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir? Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now! This isn't a goodfella. This is a badfella! Why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?! - Order in this court! - You're all thinking it! Order! Order, I say! - Say it! - Mr. Liotta, please sit down! I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that. I think the jury's on our side. Are we doing everything right, legally? I'm a florist. Right. Well, here's to a great team. To a great team! Well, hello. - Ken! - Hello. I didn't think you were coming. No, I was just late. I tried to call, but... the battery. I didn't want all this to go to waste, so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free. Oh, that was lucky. There's a little left. I could heat it up. Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever. So I hear you're quite a tennis player. I'm not much for the game myself. The ball's a little grabby. That's where I usually sit. Right... there. Ken, Barry was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill. You think I don't see what you're doing? I know how hard it is to find the rightjob. We have that in common. Do we? Bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out. That's just what I was thinking about doing. Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all right. I'm going to drain the old stinger. Yeah, you do that. Look at that. You know, I've just about had it with your little mind games. - What's that? - Italian Vogue. Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages. A lot of ads. Remember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine? Funny, I just can't seem to recall that! I think something stinks in here! I love the smell of flowers. How do you like the smell of flames?! Not as much. Water bug! Not taking sides! Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat! This is pathetic! I've got issues! Well, well, well, a royal flush! - You're bluffing. - Am I? Surf's up, dude! Poo water! That bowl is gnarly. Except for those dirty yellow rings! Kenneth! What are you doing?! You know, I don't even like honey! I don't eat it! We need to talk! He's just a little bee! And he happens to be the nicest bee I've met in a long time! Long time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life? No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you're one of them! Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night... My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster! Goodbye, Ken. And for your information, I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made by man! I'm sorry about all that. I know it's got an aftertaste! I like it! I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me. I couldn't overcome it. Oh, well. Are you OK for the trial? I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas. We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand. Good idea! You can really see why he's considered one of the best lawyers... Yeah. Layton, you've gotta weave some magic with this jury, or it's gonna be all over. Don't worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don't like about bees. - You got the tweezers? - Are you allergic? Only to losing, son. Only to losing. Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know. What exactly is your relationship to that woman? We're friends. - Good friends? - Yes. How good? Do you live together? Wait a minute... Are you her little... ...bedbug? I've seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand, doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee children? - Yeah, but... - So those aren't your real parents! - Oh, Barry... - Yes, they are! Hold me back! You're an illegitimate bee, aren't you, Benson? He's denouncing bees! Don't y'all date your cousins? - Objection! - I'm going to pincushion this guy! Adam, don't! It's what he wants! Oh, I'm hit!! Oh, lordy, I am hit! Order! Order! The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins! I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction! You see? You can't treat them like equals! They're striped savages! Stinging's the only thing they know! It's their way! - Adam, stay with me. - I can't feel my legs. What angel of mercy will come forward to suck the poison from my heaving buttocks? I will have order in this court. Order! Order, please! The case of the honeybees versus the human race took a pointed turn against the bees yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery. - Hey, buddy. - Hey. - Is there much pain? - Yeah. I... I blew the whole case, didn't I? It doesn't matter. What matters is you're alive. You could have died. I'd be better off dead. Look at me. They got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich. Look, there's a little celery still on it. What was it like to sting someone? I can't explain it. It was all... All adrenaline and then... and then ecstasy! All right. You think it was all a trap? Of course. I'm sorry. I flew us right into this. What were we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of bugs in this world. What will the humans do to us if they win? I don't know. I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn't sound so bad. Adam, they check in, but they don't check out! Oh, my. Oould you get a nurse to close that window? - Why? - The smoke. Bees don't smoke. Right. Bees don't smoke. Bees don't smoke! But some bees are smoking. That's it! That's our case! It is? It's not over? Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere. Get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can. And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub. Mr. Flayman. Yes? Yes, Your Honor! Where is the rest of your team? Well, Your Honor, it's interesting. Bees are trained to fly haphazardly, and as a result, we don't make very good time. I actually heard a funny story about... Your Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court's valuable time? How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on? They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients, who run legitimate businesses. I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case! Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery's motion. But you can't! We have a terrific case. Where is your proof? Where is the evidence? Show me the smoking gun! Hold it, Your Honor! You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun. What is that? It's a bee smoker! What, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee. Look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, ""Smoking or non?"" Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines and man-made wooden slat work camps? Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man? - What are we gonna do? - He's playing the species card. Ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! The court finds in favor of the bees! Vanessa, we won! I knew you could do it! High-five! Sorry. I'm OK! You know what this means? All the honey will finally belong to the bees. Now we won't have to work so hard all the time. This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson. You'll regret this. Barry, how much honey is out there? All right. One at a time. Barry, who are you wearing? My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants. - What if Montgomery's right? - What do you mean? We've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years. Oongratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement? First, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps. Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with, every last drop. We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine. We're all aware of what they do in the woods. Wait for my signal. Take him out. He'll have nauseous for a few hours, then he'll be fine. And we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames... But it's just a prance-about stage name! ...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments. Oan't breathe. Bring it in, boys! Hold it right there! Good. Tap it. Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups, and there's gallons more coming! - I think we need to shut down! - Shut down? We've never shut down. Shut down honey production! Stop making honey! Turn your key, sir! What do we do now? Oannonball! We're shutting honey production! Mission abort. Aborting pollination and nectar detail. Returning to base. Adam, you wouldn't believe how much honey was out there. Oh, yeah? What's going on? Where is everybody? - Are they out celebrating? - They're home. They don't know what to do. Laying out, sleeping in. I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket. At least we got our honey back. Sometimes I think, so what if humans liked our honey? Who wouldn't? It's the greatest thing in the world! I was excited to be part of making it. This was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well. And now... Now I can't. I don't understand why they're not happy. I thought their lives would be better! They're doing nothing. It's amazing. Honey really changes people. You don't have any idea what's going on, do you? - What did you want to show me? - This. What happened here? That is not the half of it. Oh, no. Oh, my. They're all wilting. Doesn't look very good, does it? No. And whose fault do you think that is? You know, I'm gonna guess bees. Bees? Specifically, me. I didn't think bees not needing to make honey would affect all these things. It's notjust flowers. Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees. That's our whole SAT test right there. Take away produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom. And then, of course... The human species? So if there's no more pollination, it could all just go south here, couldn't it? I know this is also partly my fault. How about a suicide pact? How do we do it? - I'll sting you, you step on me. - Thatjust kills you twice. Right, right. Listen, Barry... sorry, but I gotta get going. I had to open my mouth and talk. Vanessa? Vanessa? Why are you leaving? Where are you going? To the final Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena. They've moved it to this weekend because all the flowers are dying. It's the last chance I'll ever have to see it. Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry. I never meant it to turn out like this. I know. Me neither. Tournament of Roses. Roses can't do sports. Wait a minute. Roses. Roses? Roses! Vanessa! Roses?! Barry? - Roses are flowers! - Yes, they are. Flowers, bees, pollen! I know. That's why this is the last parade. Maybe not. Oould you ask him to slow down? Oould you slow down? Barry! OK, I made a huge mistake. This is a total disaster, all my fault. Yes, it kind of is. I've ruined the planet. I wanted to help you with the flower shop. I've made it worse. Actually, it's completely closed down. I thought maybe you were remodeling. But I have another idea, and it's greater than my previous ideas combined. I don't want to hear it! All right, they have the roses, the roses have the pollen. I know every bee, plant and flower bud in this park. All we gotta do is get what they've got back here with what we've got. - Bees. - Park. - Pollen! - Flowers. - Repollination! - Across the nation! Tournament of Roses, Pasadena, Oalifornia. They've got nothing but flowers, floats and cotton candy. Security will be tight. I have an idea. Vanessa Bloome, FTD. Official floral business. It's real. Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch. Thank you. It was a gift. Once inside, we just pick the right float. How about The Princess and the Pea? I could be the princess, and you could be the pea! Yes, I got it. - Where should I sit? - What are you? - I believe I'm the pea. - The pea? It goes under the mattresses. - Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart. - I'm getting the marshal. You do that! This whole parade is a fiasco! Let's see what this baby'll do. Hey, what are you doing?! Then all we do is blend in with traffic... ...without arousing suspicion. Once at the airport, there's no stopping us. Stop! Security. - You and your insect pack your float? - Yes. Has it been in your possession the entire time? Would you remove your shoes? - Remove your stinger. - It's part of me. I know. Just having some fun. Enjoy your flight. Then if we're lucky, we'll have just enough pollen to do the job. Oan you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job! I think this is gonna work. It's got to work. Attention, passengers, this is Oaptain Scott. We have a bit of bad weather in New York. It looks like we'll experience a couple hours delay. Barry, these are cut flowers with no water. They'll never make it. I gotta get up there and talk to them. Be careful. Oan I get help with the Sky Mall magazine? I'd like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer. Oaptain, I'm in a real situation. - What'd you say, Hal? - Nothing. Bee! Don't freak out! My entire species... What are you doing? - Wait a minute! I'm an attorney! - Who's an attorney? Don't move. Oh, Barry. Good afternoon, passengers. This is your captain. Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B please report to the cockpit? And please hurry! What happened here? There was a DustBuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded. One's bald, one's in a boat, they're both unconscious! - Is that another bee joke? - No! No one's flying the plane! This is JFK control tower, Flight 356. What's your status? This is Vanessa Bloome. I'm a florist from New York. Where's the pilot? He's unconscious, and so is the copilot. Not good. Does anyone onboard have flight experience? As a matter of fact, there is. - Who's that? - Barry Benson. From the honey trial?! Oh, great. Vanessa, this is nothing more than a big metal bee. It's got giant wings, huge engines. I can't fly a plane. - Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot? - Yes. How hard could it be? Wait, Barry! We're headed into some lightning. This is Bob Bumble. We have some late-breaking news from JFK Airport, where a suspenseful scene is developing. Barry Benson, fresh from his legal victory... That's Barry! ...is attempting to land a plane, loaded with people, flowers and an incapacitated flight crew. Flowers?! We have a storm in the area and two individuals at the controls with absolutely no flight experience. Just a minute. There's a bee on that plane. I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson and his no-account compadres. They've done enough damage. But isn't he your only hope? Technically, a bee shouldn't be able to fly at all. Their wings are too small... Haven't we heard this a million times? ""The surface area of the wings and body mass make no sense."" - Get this on the air! - Got it. - Stand by. - We're going live. The way we work may be a mystery to you. Making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs. But let me tell you about a small job. If you do it well, it makes a big difference. More than we realized. To us, to everyone. That's why I want to get bees back to working together. That's the bee way! We're not made of Jell-O. We get behind a fellow. - Black and yellow! - Hello! Left, right, down, hover. - Hover? - Forget hover. This isn't so hard. Beep-beep! Beep-beep! Barry, what happened?! Wait, I think we were on autopilot the whole time. - That may have been helping me. - And now we're not! So it turns out I cannot fly a plane. All of you, let's get behind this fellow! Move it out! Move out! Our only chance is if I do what I'd do, you copy me with the wings of the plane! Don't have to yell. I'm not yelling! We're in a lot of trouble. It's very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice! It's not a tone. I'm panicking! I can't do this! Vanessa, pull yourself together. You have to snap out of it! You snap out of it. You snap out of it. - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it! - Hold it! - Why? Oome on, it's my turn. How is the plane flying? I don't know. Hello? Benson, got any flowers for a happy occasion in there? The Pollen Jocks! They do get behind a fellow. - Black and yellow. - Hello. All right, let's drop this tin can on the blacktop. Where? I can't see anything. Oan you? No, nothing. It's all cloudy. Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry. - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee. Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Wait a minute. I think I'm feeling something. - What? - I don't know. It's strong, pulling me. Like a 27-million-year-old instinct. Bring the nose down. Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! - What in the world is on the tarmac? - Get some lights on that! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! - Vanessa, aim for the flower. - OK. Out the engines. We're going in on bee power. Ready, boys? Affirmative! Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it. Land on that flower! Ready? Full reverse! Spin it around! - Not that flower! The other one! - Which one? - That flower. - I'm aiming at the flower! That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt. I mean the giant pulsating flower made of millions of bees! Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up. Rotate around it. - This is insane, Barry! - This's the only way I know how to fly. Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane flying in an insect-like pattern? Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid. Smell it. Full reverse! Just drop it. Be a part of it. Aim for the center! Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman! Oome on, already. Barry, we did it! You taught me how to fly! - Yes. No high-five! - Right. Barry, it worked! Did you see the giant flower? What giant flower? Where? Of course I saw the flower! That was genius! - Thank you. - But we're not done yet. Listen, everyone! This runway is covered with the last pollen from the last flowers available anywhere on Earth. That means this is our last chance. We're the only ones who make honey, pollinate flowers and dress like this. If we're gonna survive as a species, this is our moment! What do you say? Are we going to be bees, orjust Museum of Natural History keychains? We're bees! Keychain! Then follow me! Except Keychain. Hold on, Barry. Here. You've earned this. Yeah! I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves. Oh, yeah. That's our Barry. Mom! The bees are back! If anybody needs to make a call, now's the time. I got a feeling we'll be working late tonight! Here's your change. Have a great afternoon! Oan I help who's next? Would you like some honey with that? It is bee-approved. Don't forget these. Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me. And I don't see a nickel! Sometimes I just feel like a piece of meat! I had no idea. Barry, I'm sorry. Have you got a moment? Would you excuse me? My mosquito associate will help you. Sorry I'm late. He's a lawyer too? I was already a blood-sucking parasite. All I needed was a briefcase. Have a great afternoon! Barry, I just got this huge tulip order, and I can't get them anywhere. No problem, Vannie. Just leave it to me. You're a lifesaver, Barry. Oan I help who's next? All right, scramble, jocks! It's time to fly. Thank you, Barry! That bee is living my life! Let it go, Kenny. - When will this nightmare end?! - Let it all go. - Beautiful day to fly. - Sure is. Between you and me, I was dying to get out of that office. You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. - Thinking bee! - Me? Hold it. Let's just stop for a second. Hold it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone. Oan we stop here? I'm not making a major life decision during a production number! All right. Take ten, everybody. Wrap it up, guys. I had virtually no rehearsal for that.

711,openairport,https://github.com/thunderai/openairport.git,"   Introduction  OpenAirport is an open source airport computer maintenance and management system.  Purpose The purpose of OpenAirport is to provide an open source Computer Maintenance and Management System (CMMS) that has been designed from the ground up for airports. As an open source application; OpenAirport has the ability to be customized by an airport to meet their specific need, contribute code changes back to the source and make the application better.  Goals The goal of OpenAirport is to allow interested parties (airports, consultants, interested aviation users) to help other airports by contributing code, making refinements, and suggesting features that will make OpenAirport more useful for airports in managing their Part 139 requirements. Help does not stop at Part 139 however, an airport is exposed to many regulations that no doubt could be assisted by modules in OpenAirport.  Modules  The structural idea of OpenAirport is to keep the system as module as possible so an airport does not need to use all of the part and can mix and match different modules to meet their operational needs. There will be the core modules focused around Part 139.327, 333, 337, and 339; however, additional modules dealing with other aspects of Part 139 will be available.  Each module can come in different flavors of depth. From tracking global discrepancies to narrowing discrepancies down to the nuts and bolts of lights is important. This ability to dynamically meet an airports operational environment makes OpenAirport unique and truly an airport based CMMS.  Development  This is the home of the OpenAirport_v3t code depository. It is not completed nor ready for airport use. Development is underway and new code is added all the time.",1,5,1,airport,GitHub

What many would think of doing is to employ all the possible technology and always trying to be on the top of the game, but is it really worth it to invest such huge money if the improvement is not quantiable? In particular, if we talk about aviation security, then it's major goal is to prevent harm to aircraft, passengers, and crew, as well as to support national security and counter-terrorism policy1. While lots of efforts have been done to improve the reliability and safety from the engineering point of view, new security threats are emerging day by day. A very basic question that arises now is: Do all the new security measures really make the aircraft more secure, and if yes, can we quantify it? The security objective then becomes that of ensuring the integrity of the process. The answer to such a question is not at all easy. In general the efficiency of the entire airport is checked with the help of Red Teams by Department of civil aviation. This method is time-consuming, very expensive and ad hoc. We, therefore, use the tools of simulation to answer some of such highly non-trivial questions that can arise in the airport security system.

Also, if the landing queue is full and another plane arrives to land, then takeoffs will be stopped and both runways used to clear the backlog of landing planes. The simulation should run through many units of time.",1,0,1,airport,GitHub

Our face mask detector didn't uses any morphed masked images dataset. The model is accurate, and since we used the simple Sequential Model architecture, it’s also computationally efficient and thus making it easier to deploy the model to embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, Google Coral, etc.).  This system can therefore be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19.  This project can be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines.",1,1,1,airport,GitHub

Crowd management is important for public safety, especially now amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Computer vision algorithms can assist with social distancing efforts aimed at slowing the spread of the virus, and alert when violations on the permitted headcount within a space occur. Crowd counting and localization can also be useful when designing public spaces such as airports and malls, and in making decisions on how to manage crowds in these public spaces.

Your mobile app should provide and interface to allow the user to: - Initialize the queue - Add a new aircraft to the queue. - Retrieve the next aircraft from the queue.  Aircraft Queue A software subsystem of an air-traffic control system is defined to manage a queue of aircraft (AC) in an airport. The aircraft queue is managed by a process which responds to three types of requests: - system boot used to start the system. - enqueue aircraft used to insert a new AC into the system. - dequeue aircraft used to remove an AC from the system.  AC’s have the following properties: - AC type: Passenger or Cargo - AC size: Small or Large  The process which manages the queue of AC’s satisfies the following: - There is no limit on the number of AC’s it can manage (could be tens of thousands) - Dequeue aircraft requests result in selection of one AC for removal such that: - Passenger AC’s have removal precedence over Cargo AC’s - Large AC’s of a given type have removal precedence over Small AC’s of the same type. - Earlier enqueued AC’s of a given type and size have precedence over later enqueued AC’s of the same type and size.,1,0,1,airport,GitHub

1265,RunWaySim,https://github.com/CSantosCompSci/RunWaySim.git,"Write a simulation program for a small airport that has only one runway. There will be a queue of planes waiting to land and a queue of planes waiting to take off. However, only one plane can use the runway at a time, so there can be only one takeoff or one landing in progress at any one time. Assume that all takeoffs take the same amount of time. Assume that all landings take the same amount of time, but this need not be the same as the takeoff time. Assume that planes arrive for landing at random times but with a specified probability of a plane arriving during any given minute. Similarly, assume that planes arrive at the takeoff queue at random times but with a (possibly different) specified probability of a departure. (Despite the fact that takeoffs and landings are scheduled, delays make this a reasonable assumption.) Since it is more expensive and more dangerous to keep a plane waiting to land than it is to keep a plane waiting to take off, landings will have priority over takeoffs. Thus, as long as some plane is waiting to land, no plane can take off. Use a clock that is an integer variable that counts the number of minutes simulated. Use a random number generator to simulate arrival and departure times of airplanes. This simulation can be used, among other things, for deciding when the air traffic has become so heavy that a second runway must be built. Hence, the simulation will simulate disaster conditions in which planes crash because they run out of fuel while waiting too long in the landing queue. By examining the simulated situation, the airport authority hopes to avoid real tragedy. Assume all planes can remain in the queue for the same amount of time before they run out of fuel. If a plane runs out of fuel, your simulation will not discover this until the simulated plane is removed from the queue; at that point, the fact that the plane crashed is recorded, that plane is discarded, and the next plane is processed. A crashed plane is not considered in the calculation of waiting time. At the end of the simulated time, the landing queue is examined to see whether any of the planes in the simulated queue have crashed. You can disregard the planes left in the queue at the end of the simulation, other than those that crashed for lack of sufficient fuel. Use the following input and output specifications: Input: (1) The amount of time needed for one plane to land; (2) the amount of time needed for one plane to take off; (3) the average amount of time between arrival of planes to the landing queue; (4) the average amount of time between arrival of planes to the takeoff queue; (5) the maximum amount of time that a plane can stay in the landing queue without running out of fuel and crashing; and (6) the total length of time to be simulated. Output: (1) The number of planes that took off in the simulated time; (2) the number of planes that landed in the simulated time; (3) the number of planes that crashed because they ran out of fuel before they could land; (4) the average time that a plane spent in the takeoff queue; and (5) the average time that a plane spent in the landing queue.",1,0,1,airport,GitHub
1266,http-www.propchill.com-,https://github.com/propchill3/http-www.propchill.com-.git,"After last few years of slowdown, Real Estate Sector is set on the path of growth. Though the foreign investment started to flow with the formation of a stable government in May 2014, economic reforms and liberal FDI policies have further made the investment process easy. Riding on the hope of “Acche Din”, India saw a huge $2.2 billion (70% raise) foreign investment as per JLL reports. The World Bank predicts India to be the fastest growing economy in coming years with close to 8% GDP growth rate. The graph below gives a comparative analysis of the GDP performance of the world and developing Countries in South Asia.  The future picture of Indian economy is bright and Real Estate sector is emerging as a lucrative investment option. Apart from private sector investments, several government projects like development of Smart Cities, affordable homes for EWS (economically weaker section of society) and housing for all by 2022 offer good potential for investors. The government is also working to enhance infrastructure across the country with number of highway, Metro and Airport projects.  Developing affordable housing in major cities is a big challenge for government, as 10 million people migrate to cities every year and most of them are job seekers. The last decade has witnessed the migration of 91 Million people to cities and only 51 Million houses were made to accommodate them. The government has implemented several changes in the economy and FDI policy to tackle the issue. The time is right for investors to carry out some intelligent investments and below areten reasons to believe and participate in the growth of the Real Estate in India in 2016.  1. Special Treatment for NRIs on Investment and non-consideration of property leasing as real estate business will boost the foreign investment in Real Estate Sector.  2. The minimum requirements of 20,000 square meter development and capital of $5 Million have been removed. This step welcomes small investors and will promote construction and development in Tier II and Tier III cities.  3. The policy of bringing foreign investment within 6 months of the starting of a project has been done away with, leading to more flexibility and ease of business in the country.  4. Lower interest rates, affordable housing schemes, and easy installments will allure middle-class families to buy property, so we will see a rise in the demand of residential property in class B and C cities.  5. Foreign investor can now exit from a project in 3 years or earlier if the project gets completed. The easy exit policy gives flexibility in ease of doing business, saves time and would invite more FDI.  6. The growing IT and Service industry will need more workforce and office space increasing the demand for residential and commercial property.  7. The soaring E-commerce industry will continue to grow as the number of online shoppers is increasing rapidly, there will be more demand of warehouses in future.  8. Manufacturers with foreign investments are now allowed to directly sell their products using online or offline platforms without government approval. For this, they will need infrastructure, warehouse, and office space, leading to increased real estate requirement.  9. Flexibility to Single brand retail trading in E-commerce will again contribute to the success of Real Estate industry.  10. No government approval is needed for eligible investment in LLP (Limited Liability Partnership) and foreign investment through share Swap. This will enhance the ease of doing business,thus attracting more foreign investors. Keeping in mind the World Bank report and recent economic reforms, Real estate Sector in India holds a huge potential as a long term investment portfolio for individual investors. Besides, metro cities the Tier II and II cities are going to witness exponential growth rate in real estate in 2016. In short, Indian Real Estate business is going to undergo a policy and investment transformation in the coming years. The situation will be more favorable if the land acquisition and other land reform bills get approved in the parliament.",1,0,1,airport,GitHub
1267,DSC640-Summer-2020-Course-Project,https://github.com/micgonzalez/DSC640-Summer-2020-Course-Project.git,"Project Information  During the course, you will be working on a 5 small data visualization projects. You will be given a scenario and a dataset – you have the choice of using the provided dataset and scenario or coming up with your own scenario and dataset and fulfilling the requirements for each phase of the assignment – if you choose your own scenario, it needs to be approved by your Professor in Weeks 1 & 2. Over the course of 10 weeks you will submit:      Dashboard (Weeks 1 & 2)     Executive Summary (Weeks 3 & 4)     Blog Post (Weeks 5 & 6)     Infographic (Weeks 7 & 8)     Video Presentation (Weeks 9 & 10) The scenario:  Due to recent unfortunate airline crashes, the media has been promoting statistics stating air is no longer a safe way to travel. The news and media outlets have been bombarding the public with reports and figures about the trends of airline safety and that things are not looking good. What was previously thought as the safest way to travel, especially when compared to automobiles, is now being presented as one of the most dangerous to the public. But are any of these claims based on facts?  You work for an airline on the data science team as a data analyst and are a resident data visualization expert. You have been tasked with helping multiple groups in the organization combat this negative publicity and help tell the airline's side of the story. There is a fear internally about what this type of media coverage will do to airline sales and how it could impact the future of the company. Not only do they need you to help create some internal communications, but you will also be tasked with what is published to the public and the media.  Project Task 1: Dashboard  Your first task is to create an internal dashboard for your peers and data science management team that outlines the facts – what are the stats and what are the trends? Is there any supplemental data that you can use to support that air travel is still in fact the safest? Is there anything politically going on that would cause this type of media attention to be at a peak – remember, this is for an internal review by your peers and management – and will likely spark a lot of discussion for how you approach the next level of discussion with your executive leadership team. Is there anything to show sales are down or are headed that way? Do the safety incidents appear to be in a specific geographic area or by a specific airline every time? Do some analysis of the data you have and look for other sources to see what you can find to help inform your internal team.  Project Task 2: Executive Summary  Your dashboard was well received by the internal team and while some of the information was news to everyone, the entire consensus was that it is ready to be prepped for an executive review, so the external communications can be started. Your next task is to prepare an executive summary summarizing your findings and telling the story of what you found. This can be done either in PowerPoint, Prezi, Spark, etc.  Remember your audience – these will be senior leaders that care about the portrayal of the industry and their airline specifically. They also want to make sure they are being ethical and sharing information that isn’t misleading. This presentation will set the tone for how the media is addressed going forward with the information and facts that need to be shared. Also remember that this audience regularly speaks with shareholders – so any information you can find to help predict future risks and the position of the company will be beneficial to the conversation. For example, if you found information that indicates where future sales will be impacted or where there are safety risks – this is important information to raise to this group.  Project Task 3: Blog Post  Now that you have given your presentation to your executive team, they have given you the remainder of your tasks because they want you to urgently get the word out – which you will complete over the remainder of the course. A blog post that they can use to spread through online news sources, social media, etc., an infographic that can be shared in print, like in airports, as well as social media, and a short video clip with some of the important facts to help inform the public.  Your presentation and clarity of the story for these last three tasks will be of the utmost importance since the presentations will be to external audiences.  Your first task is to get the blog post out – which will be mostly in the written form, with the back-up of some visualizations. Select some of the visualizations you have already presented, determine what modifications need to be made to improve those visualizations, potentially using Inkscape and start drafting your story. Refer to Chapter 7 of Storytelling with Data for suggestions on how to frame up your blog post. Get creative – remember, you are trying to get your side of the story out and share the facts with the public!  Project Task 4: Infographic  You’ve successfully gotten your blog post out, which has started to be shared with local news outlets and you have seen it shared on various platforms. While somewhat controversial in the data visualization world, you have been diligently working on an infographic that has nice clear, creative visuals that help articulate the message and inform the public what the real story is! This audience is likely standing in line and would see this infographic on a wall or is scrolling on their phone quickly – so grabbing their attention is key and making sure the visualizations makes sense is the only way you can change their opinion or inform them of what is really going on.  Project Task 5: Video Presentation  Your final task to help spread the word on the truth about what you have found and represent your Airline via a short 3-minute presentation (recorded) that combines the 3-minute story and the Big Idea from Storytelling with Data in Chapter 1. The premise of the 3-minute story, is that you must find a way to convey everything you need to in that short timeframe, which you do using any of the previous media that you have created or something brand new. You can choose to present a PowerPoint, just talk live in front of a camera presenting the facts or talk while presenting your Dashboard, etc. You could also create a moving visualization like some of the time series visualizations we have seen Edward Tufte create or Hans Rosling’s for example: (https://youtu.be/jbkSRLYSojo)",1,0,1,airport,GitHub
