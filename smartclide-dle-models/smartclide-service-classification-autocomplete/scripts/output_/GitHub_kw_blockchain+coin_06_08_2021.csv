13,SpreadCoin,https://github.com/BlockchainLabs/SpreadCoin.git,"SpreadCoin October 5, 2014 Introduction In proof-of-work cryptocurrencies new coins are generated by the network through the process of mining. One of the purposes of mining is to protect network from double spending attacks and history rewriting. Miners generate new blocks and check contents of the blocks generated by other peers for conformation to the network rules. However, many miners now delegate all the checking work crucial to cryptocurrency security to pools. This means that pool operators do not have any large hashing power but have control over generation of new blocks. This brings unnecessary centralization to otherwise decentralized system. Controlling more than 50% of mining power allows to perform double-spending attacks with 100% chance of success but even with less than 50% control it is possible to perform attacks which have chances to succeed1 . The core idea of SpreadCoin is to prevent creation of pools and thus make mining more decentralized and the whole system more secure. Pool Prevention In pooled mining miners perform only the work which is necessary to fulfill the proof-of-work requirements and pools take care of block generation and broadcasting and distribute reward among miners according to the shares they submit. In this scheme miner has two alternatives: 1. Solo mining. In this case miner cannot send shares to the pool because they will not be accepted. 2. Pooled mining. Miner‚Äôs shares will be accepted by the pool but in the case miner will actually generate a new block its reward will go to the pool which will redistribute it to all miners. This allows organization of pools because miners has no way to cheat and steal generated money. To prevent creation of pools we must remove this possibility so that if pool will be created than miner can mine in a pool, submit shares as usual and get reward for them but in the case of actually finding a block miner can send it directly to the network instead of the pool and get full reward for it. In SpreadCoin mining is organized in such way that miner must know the following things: 1. Private key corresponding to the coinbase transaction. 2. Whole block, not only its header. This ensures that miner can broadcast mined block and spend coins generated in that block. It may seem that it is necessary to know only the private key to spend coinbase transaction. If two conflicting transactions will appear on the network then the one that was broadcasted first will have much higher probability to be included in a block because each peer remembers and retransmits only the first one of the conflicting transactions. If both miner and pool know private key but only pool knows the content of the block than pool can generate and broadcast spending transaction earlier than miner. If both miner  1 Double-spending. Bitcoin Wiki. https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Double-spending and pool know content of the block than miner will be the first one who can broadcast block and spending transaction. To prove knowledge of the private key and whole block there are two new fields in the block header: MinerSignature and hashWholeBlock. MinerSignature is a digital signature of all fields of the block header except for the hashWholeBlock. Changing any information in the block requires regeneration of this signature which means that it is necessary to recalculate it during each iteration of the mining process. This implies that miner must be able to sign any arbitrary data. hashWholeBlock is a SHA-256 hash of the block data arranged as follows: Padding ensures that there is no incentive to mine empty blocks without transactions. Padding values are computed using simple algorithm which initializes last 32 bytes (8 uint32) with hashPrevBlock and then goes backward and computes remaining uint32 values using the following recursive formula: ùêºùëñ = ùêºùëñ+3 ‚àô ùêºùëñ+7. This algorithm ensures that there is no efficient way to compute padding values on the fly during hash computation which otherwise could potentially give some advantage to mine empty blocks in certain computing environments. It is important that block is hashed twice. If it was hashed only once then pool could hash the beginning of the block and send resulting hash state to the miners. Each miner would then modify some information in the end of the block and recalculate the hash based on the known state without actual knowledge about what is contained in the beginning of the block. Appending block data to itself make it necessary to know the whole block to recalculate hashWholeBlock. Pool may detect and ban cheating miners. However, many miners may still prefer to cheat so that pool will be completely unusable for honest miners. Miners that have low probability of finding a block will get more profit by stealing reward for accidentally found block even if pool will ban them thereafter. Miners that have enough mining power to find blocks consistently can still connect to a pool and submit shares for some time but steal the first found block. This way they can get both reward for their shares and the actual mined block. Given all this it is expected that no one will create a pool. But even if someone will than it can be countered by releasing stealing miner software which many miners will switch to. Compact Transactions SpreadCoin as well as Bitcoin uses ECDSA signatures. Each address in Bitcoin is a hash of an ECDSA public key. To spend coins sent to an address it is necessary to provide public key matching to that hash and a signature. This results in 139 or 107 bytes for each transaction input script (scriptSig) depending on Block Padding MAX_BLOCK_SIZE Block Padding whether compact public key is used. However, it is possible to recover public key from the signature2 which means that it is not necessary to provide it in transaction input. Together with using compact representation of the signature3 it allows to reduce size of transaction input script from 139 or 107 bytes in Bitcoin to 67 bytes in SpreadCoin. Recovering public key has almost no extra CPU cost compared to the usual signature verification process used in Bitcoin. This is important because the CPU cost of ECDSA signature verification is a bottleneck for Bitcoin transaction processing. Usual output script (scriptPubKey) in Bitcoin looks as follows: OP_DUP OP_HASH160 5bd18804e4bb43a4bb8b6bc88408970bafaf4a38 OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG In SpreadCoin the semantics of the OP_CHECKSIG instruction was changed to checking signature by hash of the public key (it recovers public key and compares its hash with the provided one). This results in a much simpler script in SpreadCoin: 5bd18804e4bb43a4bb8b6bc88408970bafaf4a38 OP_CHECKSIG This results in additional minor space saving because this script is 3 bytes smaller. Smooth Supply Block reward in Bitcoin is computed using the following formula: ùëÖ‚Ñé = ùëÖ0 ‚àô 2 ‚àí‚åä ‚Ñé ùëù ‚åã , where ‚Ñé ‚Äì block height, ùëù ‚Äì reward halving period, ùëÖ0 ‚Äì initial reward, ùëÖ‚Ñé ‚Äì reward for block ‚Ñé, ‚åä ‚åã ‚Äì floor function. This method results in abrupt reward changes near halving points. SpreadCoin uses simple linear interpolation between halving points to make reward decrease much smother. This is achieved by modifying reward using the following formula: ùëÖ‚Ñé ‚Ä≤ = 4 3 (ùëÖ‚Ñé ‚àí ùëÖ‚Ñé ‚àô ‚Ñé mod ùëù 2ùëù ). SpreadCoin uses ùëù = 2 ‚àô 106 as its reward halving period.  2 ECDSA Signatures allow recovery of the public key. Bitcoin Forum. https://bitcointalk.org/?topic=6430.0%29%3F 3 Why the signature is always 65 (1+32+32) bytes long? Bitcoin Stack Exchange. https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/12554/why-the-signature-is-always-65-13232-bytes-long | NO YEAR 2106 PROBLEM The time stamp field in the block header is now 64 bit instead of 32 bit (Bitcoin) so that much farther date times are possible (>Year 2106) Upcoming features that are in development and will be introduced over the next weeks and months: SERVICENODES A servicenode is a node which runs continuously (24/7) on a server and which provides services within the spreadcoin network.  You have to pay a collateral to be able to install a servernode (in return your servicenode will earn a steady income).   This collateral is determined by a free market price discovery.  (No fix collateral. The price is allowed to fluctuate over time.) COMPETITIVE COLLATERAL Furthermore, to introduce a competitive nature to the servicenodes there will only ever be a limited number of allowed servicenodes worldwide.  Since the collateral isn't set in stone, but the amount of servicenodes is fixed, the price of a servicenode will be determined by the participants themselves.  It is expected that the price will vary widely over time, which exposes it to the same market forces that hashrate and currency value are exposed to too. SERVICE APPS There are a number of decentralized applications that will run on servicenodes.  Most likely those apps will include:  1) ""Spread the message"" (an in-wallet encrypted messaging system, which allows you to send a message to an SPR address)  2) ""Spread the Search"" (A decentralized search engine that lets the servicenodes crawl and map the entire internet.)  . SPREADX11 SpreadX11 is different from plain X11 by introducing a sophisticated pool prevention mechanism.  With SpreadX11 every block header contains additional information (MinerSignature and hashWholeBlock). With the help of this information the protocol ensures that the miner of a new block is always also the first one to know the content of the whole block and the private key to spend the coinbase transaction. (contrary to pool mining where the pool operator is the first one to know those things)  So when a miner finds a block, he must himself sign and transmit the block to the network (like solo mining), instead of having a pool handle this for him.  This effectively prevents pools by making their rules non-enforceable, since any miner in any assumed pool can always just steal the block reward instead of following the rules set up by the pool. COMPACT TRANSACTIONS SpreadCoin uses a more compact representation for signatures in transactions.  SpreadCoin as well as Bitcoin uses ECDSA signatures. While bitcoin keeps a copy of the public key of the corresponding signature around, SpreadCoin ommits this by recovering the public key on the fly directly from the signature.  This way it is not necessary to keep the public key of every ECDSA signature in the blockchain, so this leads to *smaller transactions and hence a smaller blockchain (at the cost of a few CPU cycles more).  (*reduction in size of transaction from 139 or 107 bytes in Bitcoin to 67 bytes in SpreadCoin.) SMOOTH HALVING Unlike Bitcoin, there are no abrupt reward halvings in SpreadCoin. Block reward is smoothly decreasing over time. UNIQUE DESIGN WITH IN-WALLET VANITYGEN One of the first apps to be built into the wallet is the vanity generator (or vanity gen) which allows anyone to create personalised payment addresses.  The easy to use wallet lets you search through trillions of payment addresses allowing you to find one or multiple vanity addresses, which are then stored safely along with the private keys on your own computer - and nowhere else.  Searching using the vanity gen is probabilistic, so the amount of time required to find your chosen address patterns depends on how complex the pattern is, the speed of your computer, and a little bit of luck.  You can use the vanity gen for a bit of fun, to make your address standout from the crowd or to create a link to a brand, business or other organisation. You can even search for addresses that others might be willing to buy from you. SpreadCoin is a new cryptocurrency which is more decentralized than Bitcoin. It prevents centralization of hashing power in pools, which is one of the main concerns of Bitcoin security. SpreadCoin was fairly launched on 29 July 2014, 9:00 UTC with no premine.

Some are calling The DAO hack the most expensive bug bounty ever held, but whoever said this certainly didn‚Äôt have his Ether invested in The DAO, as the situation regarding the seizure of the stolen funds doesn‚Äôt seem to be improving.  The DAO happened, it failed, all we can do now is move on and learn from our mistakes. The problem is that if we keep learning from $50m errors, we‚Äôll be the wisest and poorest people on the planet.  That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs good to have training wheels sometimes. Ethereum is the perfect playground for skilled developers, but with its 700% value increase since creation, it has made Solidity, one of the programming languages in Ethereum, a very expensive toy.  That‚Äôs why Krypton has launched an open invitation to all developers to poke around the Krypton blockchain and see what it has to offer.  Krypton (KR) is an Ethereum-based cryptocurrency that allows users all the same features and perks (Smart Contracts, Dapps, DAOs, DACs) but for a lower ‚Äúprice.‚Äù Ethereum transaction fees, which are known as ‚ÄúGas‚Äù are spent according to computational costs, which means that the higher the price of Ether, the higher those costs will be.  covertress, the Krypton founder, and project manager said:  We‚Äôve contacted several faculties at major universities and invited them to use the KR chain for this purpose. All of this means that developers have a testbed for smart contracts and Dapps, which are less expensive to deploy in the KR blockchain, before moving on to a more mainstream environment like Ethereum. Krypton can now be considered as a ‚Äúgateway‚Äù into Ethereum.  The team isn‚Äôt planning to stay humble forever but will, however, take their time before deploying anything and becoming a direct competitor to Ethereum, allowing them to tighten up security and functionality before moving on to providing smart contracts and Dapp solutions for companies.

Kick Starter Coins: Below is a list of coins that will be included during the initial phase of this project.  Listed coins will stake on behalf of SaluS project, stakes will be sold on exchanges to increase BTC reserve.   Cloud Staking Service: Fees will be 5% of the stakes, however, the advantages listed below easily outweigh the fees.  1) Experience, keen knowledge of Coin specs. 2) Customized wallets for optimum stacking 3) Staking Advantage, (whaling weight/diff), Research for Optimum block size. 4) 24/7 Uptime, No Hassle, no worry, No Resource staking.  Affiliate programs: All profit made from affiliate programs will go to SaluS reserve to increase NAV.  If you hold Salus coin and would like to help your investment grow, sign up for the services listed below using provided links.  Foundation Transaction Fee - .0001 This is a separate TX fee of .0001 that goes to a specific Address, called the Foundation Transaction fee. This fee is in place for couple of reasons. 1) To control inflation since the supply is set to increase by 1% annually. 2) Resold to increase the reserve.  Mining Guaranteed Minimum CPU hash rate of 1000H/s   Would encourage everyone invested in this coin with CPU power to spare, to click on the link below. link will be up soon.  Traders Advantage: Top 10 Claimed Addresses on the rich list will have access to all trades and portfolio activity/status in near real time. There will be a fee for those who are not on top 10 list but would like to have access to such information. All fees will be added to the reserve fund.  MultiPool: http://hashgoal.com/  ""Holy Grail"" - Financial Instrument Will not disclose any information about this project at this time, but I do believe this will take SaluS to a whole new level if it gets off the ground.   (details on this project will be announced as soon as development officially starts) ",7,14,7,blockchain+coin,GitHub

34,Pebblecoin,https://github.com/BlockchainLabs/Pebblecoin.git,"Pebblecoin    UPDATE 2015/12/31: Version 0.4.4.1 is now out.  The major change is optimizing the daemon to use less RAM.  It no longer keeps all the blocks, which are rarely needed, in RAM, and so RAM usage has decreased from around 2 gigabytes, to under 200 megabytes.  Mac binaries are also now available.  The new wallet is compatible with the old wallet - simply turn off the old wallet, and start the new wallet, and the blockchain will update automatically to use less RAM.  Code: Release Notes 0.4.4.1 - (All) Fix blockchain RAM usage, from almost 2 GB to less than 200 MB   - Seamless blockchain conversion on first run with new binaries - (Qt) Fix high CPU usage - (Qt) Fix sync indicator (# of total blocks) - (Mac) Mac binaries - Technical Notes:   - (All) Blockchain disk-backed storage with sqlite3 and stxxl   - (Mac) Fix mac compilation   - (All) Update build files & instructions for linux, mac, windows   - (All) Remove unused protobuf and OpenSSL dependencies for Qt wallet   - (Tests) Fix valgrind errors   - (Tests) Use local directory for blockchain instead of default directory   - (Tests) Run tests on Windows if using new enough MSVC  LINKS: Windows 64-bit: https://www.dropbox.com/s/b4kubwwnb4t7o4w/pebblecoin-all-win32-x64-v0.4.4.1.zip?dl=0 Mac 64-bit: https://www.dropbox.com/s/uoy9z1oxu4x53cv/pebblecoin-all-mac-x64-v0.4.4.1.tar.gz?dl=0 Linux 64-bit: https://www.dropbox.com/s/jq3h3bc29jmndks/pebblecoin-all-linux-x64-v0.4.4.1.tar.gz?dl=0  Exchange: https://poloniex.com/exchange#btc_xpb .

This is a minor, mostly bug-fix release.  Work continues on the next major release which will bring us user-created currencies and user-graded contracts. Release notes: Code: Release Notes 0.4.3.1 - RPC calls for DPOS:   - getdelegateinfos RPC call   - get kimageseqs RPC call   - block header contains signing_delegate_id - fix checkpoint rollback bug - fix inability to send coins if voting history was lost   UPDATE 2015/05/04: Version 0.4.2.2 is now out.  This is a bug-fix/cosmetic release.  Release notes: Payment ID support Windows installer Logos updated Improved DPOS tab Sync issues fully fixed Fix rare crash bug Fix min out 0 bug Fix debit display Fix GUI not updating Updated hard-coded seed nodes   UPDATE 2015/04/24: The switch-over to DPOS has succeeded without a hitch!  DPOS blocks are being signed as we speak, at the far faster pace of 15 seconds per block.  This marks the start of a new era for Pebblecoin.   UPDATE 2015/04/21: Congratulations to the first registered delegate!  This indicates the start of the forking change so everybody please update your daemons if you haven't already.    To promote the coin and encourage people to become delegates, we've come up with an incentive scheme.  First, we'll send a free 100 XPB to anybody who PMs me their public address, for people to play around with and to start using the coin.  Second, once DPOS starts, for the first month of DPOS I'll send an extra 0.5 XPB to the signing delegate for every block they process.  This is on top of the usual transaction fees they will receive.  This is to encourage more people to become delegates at this important phase of the coin.   UPDATE 2015/04/19: All went well on the testnet release, so after a few further minor modifications, we are releasing version 0.4.1.2 to the public.  This is a forking change, so please update your clients and servers (links below).  At block 83120, sometime on April 21st, registration for DPOS delegates will begin.  At block 85300, sometime on April 24th, the network will switch over to DPOS.  As with the testnet, to become a delegate and receive block fees for securing the network, just turn on your wallet, register to be a delegate (5 XPB fee), and then leave your wallet on.  It will sign the blocks when it is your turn.  While Roman works on the next phase of the release - introducing subcurrencies - I will be fixing up some loose ends on the wallet, adding payment ID support, etc.  This is truly an exciting time for Pebblecoin.  RELEASE NOTES: All clients adjust internal clocks using ntp (client list in src/common/ntp_time.cpp) Added testnet support DPOS registration starts Block 83120 (~April 21st) DPOS phase starts Block 85300 (~April 24th) Default fee bumped to 0.10 XPB Low-free transactions no longer get relayed by default Significantly improved wallet sync Checkpoint at Block 79000   TOTAL CURRENT COINS: Available at this link.

UPDATE: The Pebblecoin Pool is now live!   Instructions: Download the linux miner and run it: ./minerd -o stratum+tcp://69.60.113.21:3350 -u YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS -p x   UPDATE: The Pebblecoin wallet is now live!     There have been thousands of attempts at alternative currencies in the community.  Many are 100% copies of existing blockchains with a different name.  Some are very slight variations with no significant differences.  From recent history it is apparent the only realistic chance for viability of a new currency is one that is innovation and continued support and development.  The bitcoin community for good reason has shown interest in currencies that provide privacy of transactions, several currencies such as darkcoin, have become popular based on this desire.  The best technology for privacy is cryptonote although for a variety of reasons there hasnt been much development for ease of use, and as a result there has not been significant adoption.  Pebblecoin (XPB) is a cryptonote based coin with improvements and changes in some areas, and the promise of development in others.  I invite developers to work on this technology with me.  There is no premine, any tips or support of any developer including myself will be completely voluntary.  These are the following areas which I have determined needs changes/updates: I welcome suggestions, and am interested what else I can try to improve.  1) New Mining algorithm (active)  A mining algorithm is either susceptible to ASIC development or to being botnetted, meaning it is either more efficient to have a centralized mining entity (as is the case with bitcoin) or to have an algorithm that requires a real CPU, in which case botnets become very attractive.  To my knowledge there does not exist a blockchain that attempts to solve both problems, by having an algorithm that only works on a general purpose computer and is difficult to botnet.  Cryptonote coins currently are primarily mined with botnets.  Boulderhash is a new mining algorithm requiring 13 GB RAM, nearly eliminating all possible zombie (botnet controlled) computers from mining.  Most infected computers in the world do not have 13 GB available, so an algorithm that requires that much RAM severely limits the productivity of a botnet.  13 GB also makes ASICs cost prohibitive, and the current GPUs do not have that much RAM.  What's left is general purpose computers as was the original intent of bitcoin's mining process.  2) Distribution of coins (active)  It is very common in the launch of a new cryptocurrency the distribution algorithm heavily is weighted towards the very early adopters.  Such distribution is designed to give a massive advantage to people who are fully prepared to mine at launch, with a very large difference shortly after sometimes a few days later.  If the point of mining is to both secure the network and fairly distribute coins a gradual build up of rewards makes more sense, with no drop off in mining rewards.  At a standard block reward of 300, at launch each block will reward 0.3 coins leading up to 3, 30, and finally the standard reward of 300 which will be the standard unchanging reward from that point.  It will take approximately 3 weeks for the block reward of 300 to be reached.  3) GUI Software (active)  There are no current cryptonote coins that have a downloadable GUI, which makes the user experience much worse than that of bitcoin.  It is hard to achieve signficant adoption with a command line interface.  The very first update had the exact GUI written for bitcoin fully working with Pebblecoin.  The GUI was released on Jan 19, before the full 300 XPB reward was awarded for winning the block.  4) IRC Chat support embedded in Client GUI (active)  For user support, and to talk to core developers message boards such as Bitcointalk and reddit are primarily used.  I have embedded an IRC client in the GUI and be available at set hours for any kind of support.   5) Address aliasing (to be worked on)  Just as a user visiting google does not need to know the ip address, similarly an address should have the ability to have an associated userid.  If I ask a friend to send me pebblecoins it would be easier to tell him send it to @myuserid rather than a very long address or scanning a QR code.  There should be a way of registering a userid on the blockchain that will permanently translate to a pebblecoin addresss.   QT INSTRUCTIONS: Download the package for your respective platform Run the Qt executable.  The software will generate a new wallet for you and use a default folder: ~/.pebblecoin on Linux and %appdata%\pebblecoin on Windows. To use an existing wallet, copy the wallet.keys file into the default folder. To use a different data directory and/or wallet file, run the software like so: ./pebblecoin-qt --data-dir <DataDir> --wallet-file <FileName>. To enable mining, run the start_mining_NEEDS_13GB_RAM.bat batch file. Or run the qt wallet with the --enable-boulderhash command line option, or put enable-boulderhash=1 into the config file.  It will start mining to the wallet address.  To change the number of mining threads (13GB required per thread), do --mining-threads <NumThreads> or edit the batch file.  DAEMON + SIMPLEWALLET INSTRUCTIONS: Download the package, run: ./pebblecoind --data-dir pebblecoin_data Once the daemon finished syncing, run the simplewallet: ./simplewallet  POOL INSTRUCTIONS: Download the miner binary for your platform. Run the miner using a wallet address gotten from simplewallet or the Qt Wallet:  Code: minerd -o stratum+tcp://69.60.113.21:3350 -u YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS -p x [/li]   DEV WALLET (for donations): PByFqCfuDRUPVsNrzrUXnuUdF7LpXsTTZXeq5cdHpJDogbJ8EBXopciN7DmQiGhLEo5ArA7dFqGga2A AhbRaZ2gL8jjp9VmYgk",6,15,6,blockchain+coin,GitHub

36,codes,https://github.com/etherceo1x1/codes.git,"BUILD YOUR OWN BLOCKCHAIN: A PYTHON TUTORIAL Download the full Jupyter/iPython notebook from Github here  Build Your Own Blockchain ‚Äì The Basics¬∂ This tutorial will walk you through the basics of how to build a blockchain from scratch. Focusing on the details of a concrete example will provide a deeper understanding of the strengths and limitations of blockchains. For a higher-level overview, I‚Äôd recommend this excellent article from BitsOnBlocks.  Transactions, Validation, and updating system state¬∂  At its core, a blockchain is a distributed database with a set of rules for verifying new additions to the database. We‚Äôll start off by tracking the accounts of two imaginary people: Alice and Bob, who will trade virtual money with each other.  We‚Äôll need to create a transaction pool of incoming transactions, validate those transactions, and make them into a block.  We‚Äôll be using a hash function to create a ‚Äòfingerprint‚Äô for each of our transactions- this hash function links each of our blocks to each other. To make this easier to use, we‚Äôll define a helper function to wrap the python hash function that we‚Äôre using.  In [1]: import hashlib, json, sys  def hashMe(msg=""""):     # For convenience, this is a helper function that wraps our hashing algorithm     if type(msg)!=str:         msg = json.dumps(msg,sort_keys=True)  # If we don't sort keys, we can't guarantee repeatability!              if sys.version_info.major == 2:         return unicode(hashlib.sha256(msg).hexdigest(),'utf-8')     else:         return hashlib.sha256(str(msg).encode('utf-8')).hexdigest() Next, we want to create a function to generate exchanges between Alice and Bob. We‚Äôll indicate withdrawals with negative numbers, and deposits with positive numbers. We‚Äôll construct our transactions to always be between the two users of our system, and make sure that the deposit is the same magnitude as the withdrawal- i.e. that we‚Äôre neither creating nor destroying money.  In [2]: import random random.seed(0)  def makeTransaction(maxValue=3):     # This will create valid transactions in the range of (1,maxValue)     sign      = int(random.getrandbits(1))*2 - 1   # This will randomly choose -1 or 1     amount    = random.randint(1,maxValue)     alicePays = sign * amount     bobPays   = -1 * alicePays     # By construction, this will always return transactions that respect the conservation of tokens.     # However, note that we have not done anything to check whether these overdraft an account     return {u'Alice':alicePays,u'Bob':bobPays} Now let‚Äôs create a large set of transactions, then chunk them into blocks.  In [3]: txnBuffer = [makeTransaction() for i in range(30)] Next step: making our very own blocks! We‚Äôll take the first k transactions from the transaction buffer, and turn them into a block. Before we do that, we need to define a method for checking the valididty of the transactions we‚Äôve pulled into the block.  For bitcoin, the validation function checks that the input values are valid unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs), that the outputs of the transaction are no greater than the input, and that the keys used for the signatures are valid. In Ethereum, the validation function checks that the smart contracts were faithfully executed and respect gas limits.  No worries, though- we don‚Äôt have to build a system that complicated. We‚Äôll define our own, very simple set of rules which make sense for a basic token system:  The sum of deposits and withdrawals must be 0 (tokens are neither created nor destroyed) A user‚Äôs account must have sufficient funds to cover any withdrawals If either of these conditions are violated, we‚Äôll reject the transaction.  In [4]: def updateState(txn, state):     # Inputs: txn, state: dictionaries keyed with account names, holding numeric values for transfer amount (txn) or account balance (state)     # Returns: Updated state, with additional users added to state if necessary     # NOTE: This does not not validate the transaction- just updates the state!          # If the transaction is valid, then update the state     state = state.copy() # As dictionaries are mutable, let's avoid any confusion by creating a working copy of the data.     for key in txn:         if key in state.keys():             state[key] += txn[key]         else:             state[key] = txn[key]     return state In [5]: def isValidTxn(txn,state):     # Assume that the transaction is a dictionary keyed by account names      # Check that the sum of the deposits and withdrawals is 0     if sum(txn.values()) is not 0:         return False          # Check that the transaction does not cause an overdraft     for key in txn.keys():         if key in state.keys():              acctBalance = state[key]         else:             acctBalance = 0         if (acctBalance + txn[key]) < 0:             return False          return True Here are a set of sample transactions, some of which are fraudulent- but we can now check their validity!  In [6]: state = {u'Alice':5,u'Bob':5}  print(isValidTxn({u'Alice': -3, u'Bob': 3},state))  # Basic transaction- this works great! print(isValidTxn({u'Alice': -4, u'Bob': 3},state))  # But we can't create or destroy tokens! print(isValidTxn({u'Alice': -6, u'Bob': 6},state))  # We also can't overdraft our account. print(isValidTxn({u'Alice': -4, u'Bob': 2,'Lisa':2},state)) # Creating new users is valid print(isValidTxn({u'Alice': -4, u'Bob': 3,'Lisa':2},state)) # But the same rules still apply! True False False True False Each block contains a batch of transactions, a reference to the hash of the previous block (if block number is greater than 1), and a hash of its contents and the header  Building the Blockchain: From Transactions to Blocks¬∂  We‚Äôre ready to start making our blockchain! Right now, there‚Äôs nothing on the blockchain, but we can get things started by defining the ‚Äògenesis block‚Äô (the first block in the system). Because the genesis block isn‚Äôt linked to any prior block, it gets treated a bit differently, and we can arbitrarily set the system state. In our case, we‚Äôll create accounts for our two users (Alice and Bob) and give them 50 coins each.

The hash of the parent block is referenced in the child block, which contains a set of new transactions which affect system state. We can now see the state of the system, updated to include the transactions:  In [13]: state Out[13]: {'Alice': 72, 'Bob': 28} Checking Chain Validity¬∂  Now that we know how to create new blocks and link them together into a chain, let‚Äôs define functions to check that new blocks are valid- and that the whole chain is valid.  On a blockchain network, this becomes important in two ways:  When we initially set up our node, we will download the full blockchain history. After downloading the chain, we would need to run through the blockchain to compute the state of the system. To protect against somebody inserting invalid transactions in the initial chain, we need to check the validity of the entire chain in this initial download. Once our node is synced with the network (has an up-to-date copy of the blockchain and a representation of system state) it will need to check the validity of new blocks that are broadcast to the network. We will need three functions to facilitate in this:  checkBlockHash: A simple helper function that makes sure that the block contents match the hash checkBlockValidity: Checks the validity of a block, given its parent and the current system state. We want this to return the updated state if the block is valid, and raise an error otherwise. checkChain: Check the validity of the entire chain, and compute the system state beginning at the genesis block. This will return the system state if the chain is valid, and raise an error otherwise. In [14]: def checkBlockHash(block):     # Raise an exception if the hash does not match the block contents     expectedHash = hashMe( block['contents'] )     if block['hash']!=expectedHash:         raise Exception('Hash does not match contents of block %s'%                         block['contents']['blockNumber'])     return In [15]: def checkBlockValidity(block,parent,state):         # We want to check the following conditions:     # - Each of the transactions are valid updates to the system state     # - Block hash is valid for the block contents     # - Block number increments the parent block number by 1     # - Accurately references the parent block's hash     parentNumber = parent['contents']['blockNumber']     parentHash   = parent['hash']     blockNumber  = block['contents']['blockNumber']          # Check transaction validity; throw an error if an invalid transaction was found.     for txn in block['contents']['txns']:         if isValidTxn(txn,state):             state = updateState(txn,state)         else:             raise Exception('Invalid transaction in block %s: %s'%(blockNumber,txn))      checkBlockHash(block) # Check hash integrity; raises error if inaccurate      if blockNumber!=(parentNumber+1):         raise Exception('Hash does not match contents of block %s'%blockNumber)      if block['contents']['parentHash'] != parentHash:         raise Exception('Parent hash not accurate at block %s'%blockNumber)          return state In [16]: def checkChain(chain):     # Work through the chain from the genesis block (which gets special treatment),      #  checking that all transactions are internally valid,     #    that the transactions do not cause an overdraft,     #    and that the blocks are linked by their hashes.     # This returns the state as a dictionary of accounts and balances,     #   or returns False if an error was detected           ## Data input processing: Make sure that our chain is a list of dicts     if type(chain)==str:         try:             chain = json.loads(chain)             assert( type(chain)==list)         except:  # This is a catch-all, admittedly crude             return False     elif type(chain)!=list:         return False          state = {}     ## Prime the pump by checking the genesis block     # We want to check the following conditions:     # - Each of the transactions are valid updates to the system state     # - Block hash is valid for the block contents      for txn in chain[0]['contents']['txns']:         state = updateState(txn,state)     checkBlockHash(chain[0])     parent = chain[0]          ## Checking subsequent blocks: These additionally need to check     #    - the reference to the parent block's hash     #    - the validity of the block number     for block in chain[1:]:         state = checkBlockValidity(block,parent,state)         parent = block              return state We can now check the validity of the state:  In [17]: checkChain(chain) Out[17]: {'Alice': 72, 'Bob': 28} And even if we are loading the chain from a text file, e.g. from backup or loading it for the first time, we can check the integrity of the chain and create the current state:  In [18]: chainAsText = json.dumps(chain,sort_keys=True) checkChain(chainAsText) Out[18]: {'Alice': 72, 'Bob': 28} Putting it together: The final Blockchain Architecture¬∂  In an actual blockchain network, new nodes would download a copy of the blockchain and verify it (as we just did above), then announce their presence on the peer-to-peer network and start listening for transactions. Bundling transactions into a block, they then pass their proposed block on to other nodes.  We‚Äôve seen how to verify a copy of the blockchain, and how to bundle transactions into a block. If we recieve a block from somewhere else, verifying it and adding it to our blockchain is easy.  Let‚Äôs say that the following code runs on Node A, which mines the block:  In [19]: import copy nodeBchain = copy.copy(chain) nodeBtxns  = [makeTransaction() for i in range(5)] newBlock   = makeBlock(nodeBtxns,nodeBchain) Now assume that the newBlock is transmitted to our node, and we want to check it and update our state if it is a valid block:  In [20]: print(""Blockchain on Node A is currently %s blocks long""%len(chain))  try:     print(""New Block Received; checking validity..."")     state = checkBlockValidity(newBlock,chain[-1],state) # Update the state- this will throw an error if the block is invalid!     chain.append(newBlock) except:     print(""Invalid block; ignoring and waiting for the next block..."")  print(""Blockchain on Node A is now %s blocks long""%len(chain)) Blockchain on Node A is currently 7 blocks long New Block Received; checking validity... Blockchain on Node A is now 8 blocks long",6,5,6,blockchain+coin,GitHub

We have tested it for 100 nodes.   The concepts implemented are: 1. Distributed Architecture for nodes    Each node is a GenServer that contains the state in the format:    a. Blockchain        Each node must have the same copy of the blockchain at all times.      If there is any change in the blockchain made by any node, it must be advertised to all other nodes and all nodes must synchronize to this    b. Wallet      Each node has its own wallet with the Bitcoin address, private key and balance.     In this design, all the nodes can participate in transactions and also mine blocks.  2. Implemented a simulation with at least 100 participants in which coins get mined and transacted.  3. Implemented a web interface using the Phoenix that allows access to the ongoing simulation using a web browser     The Phoenix webpage dynamically displays the following     a. Transactions from sender to receiver and the amount sent as and when the transaction happens    b. Once all the transactions are mined by a node and a block is added to the blockchain, the balance of every node is calculated by traversing the            blockchain using the wallet address of node and displayed    c. A graph of balance of each node versus the nodes id is plotted to show variation of balance between nodes after transactions are mined  4.  Mining/transacting scenarios include random selection of sender and receiver nodes.     Other features are :  . Bitcoin transaction . Bitcoin wallet . Bitcoin mining or Proof of work . Creating the bitcoin address as done by the real Bitcoin System based on steps described here   https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Technical_background_of_version_1_Bitcoin_addresses . Creating a blockchain with a genesis block, adding a new block to the blockchain         after a node mines pending transactions,checking authenticity of     the blockchain and      maintaining synchronization between successive blocks. . Signing transactions with private key of the wallet and verifying them with public       key at any point for security and authentication . Finding the balance of a user wallet by the same user or any other user using only       the current blockchain as input. Here, computations are made based   on transactions  recorded in every block in the blockchain to find the balance of a particular user.    Execution Instructions  To compile and run a demonstration of the built-in functionalities in the application : In the main folder bitcoinmine, on the commandline, run the command  : mix phx.server Go to your favorite browser and type URL http://localhost:4000  To change number of nodes, in lib/start.ex in the main function, change the value of numnodes variable to whatever you want to set it to To change number of transactions per block, in lib/start.ex in the handle/1 function, change the value of numtransact variable to whatever you want to set it to",2,2,2,blockchain+coin,GitHub

Cryptocurrencies are classified as a subset of digital currencies and are also classified as a subset of alternative currencies and virtual currencies.  Caesiumcoin, created in 2018, is decentralized cryptocurrency. Numerous other cryptocurrencies have been created. These are frequently called altcoins, as a blend of alternative coin. Caesiumcoin and its derivatives use decentralized control as opposed to centralized electronic money and central banking systems. The decentralized control is related to the use of caesiumcoin's blockchain transaction database in the role of a distributed ledger.",2,0,2,blockchain+coin,GitHub

89,EthereumAnalysis,https://github.com/alenso94/EthereumAnalysis.git,"DATASET OVERVIEW Ethereum is a blockchain based distributed computing platform where users may exchange currency (Ether), provide or purchase services (smart contracts), mint their own coinage (tokens), as well as other applications. The Ethereum network is fully decentralised, managed by public-key cryptography, peer-to-peer networking, and proof-of-work to process/verify transactions.  Whilst you would normally need a CLI tool such as GETH to access the Ethereum blockchain, recent tools allow scraping all block/transactions and dump these to csv's to be processed in bulk; notably Ethereum-ETL. These dumps are uploaded daily into a repository on Google BigQuery. We have used this source as the dataset for this coursework.  A subset of the data available on BigQuery is provided at the HDFS folder /data/ethereum. The blocks, contracts and transactions tables have been pulled down and been stripped of unneeded fields to reduce their size. We have also downloaded a set of scams, both active and inactive, run on the Ethereum network via etherscamDB which is available on HDFS at /data/ethereum/scams.json.

90,AGROCOIN,https://github.com/rodomenzain/AGROCOIN.git,"How this all started?  Our journey started 20 years ago with a business franchise, where we had been producing and supplying agricultural products with hydroponic technology.  Through years, we have successfully met the high standards of the agro-industry and achieved great goals with successfully established franchises in many countries. Our mission has always been to improve and learn new things.  And then, in September of 2017, we started to work on Agrocoin.  How Agrocoin is going to push agriculture business forward?  Agricultural industry is still a difficult business for new entrepreneurs. Huge investments in lands, quality maintenance of growing products, brutal competition between new and old companies‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääall of that makes such business an uneven playing field for fresh entrepreneurs.  In Agrocoin, we want to develop a stable and efficient worldwide agriculture ecosystem where anyone can participate.  Investors are entitled to be part of agriculture business with profit-sharing system for $AGRO holders. Customers will receive an option to purchase high-quality goods from any place simply by using $AGRO coin as payments. Growers can get access to sell point (only after successfully obtaining our Agrocoin Cannabis Certificate) in our established ecosystem. With our approach to work agriculture business will be an eye-catching industry.  Why we need blockchain?  Blockchain technologies are still a nonsense for majority, but there are 3 reasons why they will change habitual way in current business operations:  Transparency Traceability Decentralization With such technical side-shift we can put our operations on public and consistent network with very low chance data to be compromised.  This solution is providing comfortable sphere for stakeholders, suppliers, customers, companies and future observers.  Why we are working in Cannabis field?  According to the Statista, the legal cannabis market will be worth an estimated $24.1B in 2025, of which $13.2B will be for medical use. Mexico is the one of the best places for cannabis growing‚Ää‚Äî‚Äälarge tracts of land, labor, water and proximity to the market naturally. It is a solution to poverty in our country, that will generate new jobs and economic inflow.  Three Cannabis sub-markets‚Äî medicinal, industrial and recreational‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwill allow Mexico to be a world leader in the production of marijuana, being this plant endemic to our country.  Contrary to indoor production in the US and Canada where producing an average kilo of cannabis grown indoors is associated with 4600 kilograms of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. In Mexico, producing Cannabis can be easily done with medium technology in a natural and organic way. #EnvironmentMatter  What are the next steps?  We want to start putting collection centers (Warehouses) in the main cities: Mexico City, Guadalajara, Culiacan, Cancun and Monterrey where we will pay to cannabis providers with $AGRO‚Äôs through the Agrocoin App (curently only Android) that allows real-time payment of $AGROs to the different producers, both large and small (of 20 plants per person, as mentioned by the proposal of Minister Olga Sanchez Cordero). Currently we have an area of 100 hectares with an installed capacity of 50  hectares for manufacturing. After Mexican Government will give cannabis a green light, we will start to produce it on our territory. Once we will select quality and we will destine it to the different markets that we already have in Canada and USA, making Agropot Oil (cannabis oil) to standardize its quality and be able to serve the different markets. We have the best certification in agricultural practices Primus GFS, which allows us to have the highest quality controls in safety and that are free of pesticides (the market requires it), so we will be training producers in plant management, flowering , pest control and environmentally friendly and innocuous techniques, since the market needs to be competitive to be competitive. After successful establishment of Cannabis + derivatives sales we are going to focus on strengthening our blockchain. Agrocoin blockchain must be mature because our net will be passing through enormous amount of data. By meaning of mature, we thinking about list of things: Instant Confirmations Network Security Nodes Enhanced Smart-Contracts Automated Blockchain Updgrading More on-chain data",2,0,2,blockchain+coin,GitHub

The problem of bitcoin in the way of its emission is the replenishment of the system with coins. Mining is limited to the number of transactions; the credit system and the infusion of Fiat money is missing and is not required for lack of credit. Fiat money - dollars are opaque system issue. The monetary system needs regular injections of unsecured money. Issuance of loans at -100% per annum. The problem is the limited access of market participants to such unsecured money. Therefore, the number of countries with a high standard of living is limited. I propose a system that solves both of these shortcomings. There are two currencies. ""Real money"" and ""Credit money"". Real money can always be bought and sold in any quantity with Commission.  Credit money is given to the user on the security of real money for a limited period. The user has the right to sell or give credit money, while the user has a record of the amount of credit money taken referred to as debt. The user has the right to replace the debt with real money in the same amount plus interest to the system. Upon expiration of the term of issuance of credit money credit money unsubstituted removed together with the debt. Real money that the user left as collateral is a Deposit for which the system charges interest with real money. A person accepting credit money can guarantee the replacement of credit money with real money by requiring the user to provide a collateral or other obligation. Transactions are carried out by blockchain technology, while the amount of remuneration for mining depends on the amount of money in transactions. Transactions are made with Commission. The user has the right to update the debt. If the user has a debt, the user has the right to take a new debt. In this case, the user has the right to make a new debt old debt, and is obliged to make interest to the system for the old debt. Transactions between the system and users are carried out using blockchain technology. The system is a blockchain user, in which an incoming transaction for the amount specified by the user is created when issuing credit and real money. The incoming transaction is sent to the user. Credit money in this form are futures and can be traded with their risks on the exchange as a separate currency. Blocks should be collected from credit and real money at the same time to make payments to miners only in real money. To solve this problem, it is advisable to collect a block of credit money, a block of real money and use one solution for the implementation of both blocks.",0,0,0,blockchain+coin,GitHub
422,whitepaper,https://github.com/peacockbsc/whitepaper.git,"1 Introduction As human beings we are usually first exposed to the gift economy of our families and tight knit communities: goods and services are provided without an explicit agreement for immediate or future rewards, but the exchange of love, kindness, and confidence. As the relationship circle is enlarged this mutual trust weakens, but the urge and willingness to cooperate does not diminish: this is when the need for an exchange economy arises. [Hayek Money: The Cryptocurrency Price Stability Solution] Cryptocurrency is a digital asset and becoming popular after the success of different crypto tokens in the market. The main technology behind the development and success of cryptocurrencies is blockchain technology. This modern technology work on the principle of decentralization. It provides better security, safety, and privacy. It reduces the risk of business and allows transparency with the key feature of decentralization. The memes Tokens gained fame in the 2021 bull market where currencies such as Dogecoin and Shiba inu hit market capitalization billions, turning thousands of small investors into millionaires in a matter of months.Turning into a real fever, accompanied by major marketing campaigns.  1.1 Blockchain Infrastructure Blockchain Technology can enhance the basic services that are essential in traditional finance and it has the potential to become the foundation for decentralized business models, empowering entrepreneurs and innovators with all the right tools. By means of a trustless and distributed infrastructure, blockchain technology is optimizing transactional costs and allows the rise of decentralized, innovative, inter-operable, borderless and transparent applications which facilitate open access and encourage permissionless innovations. [Bitcoin: A Peer-To-Peer Electronic Cash System (2009)]. Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is a blockchain that was developed as a means of utilizing solidity-based smart contracts with much greater speed and efficiency than other, competing chains. With decentralized exchanges on BSC offering lightning-fast swaps and extremely low fees, BSC has started to become one of the most widely used blockchains for Decentralized Finance (Defi). BSC uses a token protocol developed by the Binance Team called BEP-20.  Binance Smart Chain is unique for several reasons:  ‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs a sovereign blockchain, which will provide security and safety to all users and developers.  ‚Ä¢ Its native dual chain interoperability will allow cross-chain communication and scaling of high-performance dApps that require a fast and smooth user experience  ‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs EVM-compatible and will support all of the existing Ethereum toolings along with faster and cheaper transactions.  ‚Ä¢ on-chain governance with Proof of Staked Authority consensus, built on 21 validators who validate the transactions, will provide decentralization and enable significant community involvement.  2 What is PEACOCK?  ‚ÄùWhen you come to the appointed place at the appointed time and meet some person, introduce yourself as Peacock. If they do the same, then you have met a special person.‚Äù - Peacock Token is a fan-driven deflationary meme token that came to dominate the meme game. appears as the father of Shiba Inu, the real Dogecoin Killer, is a deflationary BEP20 token that aims to propose an alternative to Dogecoin‚Äôs infinite supply and be an improved version of Shiba Inu, without the high fees of the ethereum network, protection against damage from diving and preventing dumping of whales. After each transaction there is a 10% burnout, this is to supply and increase demand, you can relax and watch your Peacock investment grow, the community aims to establish itself as Smart Chain‚Äôs biggest token meme our goal is to build a strong squad that will HODL their Peacock and never sell, with the aim of bringing the price of Peacock to a $1 dollar. Do not be greedy, we need all the support from the community so that you never sell all your Peacock at the same time, due to the demand there may not be liquidity available making its value fall, when you believe it is necessary, just remove the invested amount, let‚Äôs make this the first meme coin to reach $1.               2.1 Tokenomics  Peacock is a token that has an inelastic supply, which means that each transaction made, its offer is reduced in order to add value to the asset. To ensure a fair distribuition we have decided to burn 50% of the total supply. 42% of the supply is currentyly serving a life sentence at PancakeSwap correctional facility and is never getting out an 8% for Marketing and Dev team.  ‚Ä¢ Total Supply: 420,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000  ‚Ä¢ 50% Tokens Burnt Wallet: 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead  ‚Ä¢ 42% locked in Pancakeswap Pancakeswap Address: 0x52F778A1E1c12C5520Be9a31511a8A256F0b1065  ‚Ä¢ 8% Team wallet  Dev wallet: 0xe4b8141Ef61f7eb8601b71399aF7855256d1c414  Marketing wallet: 0x1dC6d1c6d518B409CcdeDb256b2a0296Ac263e0d  Exchange liquidity: 0x12B08D7FA6C0913809EAE575FdDeC61f84aCABaD  ‚Ä¢ 10% of fees burned with each transaction.     Figure 1:      3 Community Our main objective is to build a strong community, where people from all over the world can exchange experiences and debate issues of global interest, using Peacock as a utility token. If a community is well maintained and constantly expanded, this can result ina trusting relationship between the target group and the Peacock, which can lay the foundation for loyal and stable repeat users.  3.1 Dip Damage Protection We have designed a Dip Damage Protection Mechanism Wallet where people from the community can contribute anything above $10 in BNB (BEP20) to make the protection stronger, so no whales will be able to beat our protection, members will be able to see all the transactions on blockchain happening in the Dip Damage Protection wallet.  3.2 Warning PEACOCK tokens is purely entertainment, not an investment.

423,Agrocoin-Release,https://github.com/rodomenzain/Agrocoin-Release.git,"How this all started?  Our journey started 20 years ago with a business franchise, where we had been producing and supplying agricultural products with hydroponic technology.  Through years, we have successfully met the high standards of the agro-industry and achieved great goals with successfully established franchises in many countries. Our mission has always been to improve and learn new things.  And then, in September of 2017, we started to work on Agrocoin.  How Agrocoin is going to push agriculture business forward?  Agricultural industry is still a difficult business for new entrepreneurs. Huge investments in lands, quality maintenance of growing products, brutal competition between new and old companies‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääall of that makes such business an uneven playing field for fresh entrepreneurs.  In Agrocoin, we want to develop a stable and efficient worldwide agriculture ecosystem where anyone can participate.  Investors are entitled to be part of agriculture business with profit-sharing system for $AGRO holders. Customers will receive an option to purchase high-quality goods from any place simply by using $AGRO coin as payments. Growers can get access to sell point (only after successfully obtaining our Agrocoin Cannabis Certificate) in our established ecosystem. With our approach to work agriculture business will be an eye-catching industry.  Why we need blockchain?  Blockchain technologies are still a nonsense for majority, but there are 3 reasons why they will change habitual way in current business operations:  Transparency Traceability Decentralization With such technical side-shift we can put our operations on public and consistent network with very low chance data to be compromised.  This solution is providing comfortable sphere for stakeholders, suppliers, customers, companies and future observers.  Why we are working in Cannabis field?  According to the Statista, the legal cannabis market will be worth an estimated $24.1B in 2025, of which $13.2B will be for medical use. Mexico is the one of the best places for cannabis growing‚Ää‚Äî‚Äälarge tracts of land, labor, water and proximity to the market naturally. It is a solution to poverty in our country, that will generate new jobs and economic inflow.  Three Cannabis sub-markets‚Äî medicinal, industrial and recreational‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwill allow Mexico to be a world leader in the production of marijuana, being this plant endemic to our country.  Contrary to indoor production in the US and Canada where producing an average kilo of cannabis grown indoors is associated with 4600 kilograms of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. In Mexico, producing Cannabis can be easily done with medium technology in a natural and organic way. #EnvironmentMatter  What are the next steps?  We want to start putting collection centers (Warehouses) in the main cities: Mexico City, Guadalajara, Culiacan, Cancun and Monterrey where we will pay to cannabis providers with $AGRO‚Äôs through the Agrocoin App (curently only Android) that allows real-time payment of $AGROs to the different producers, both large and small (of 20 plants per person, as mentioned by the proposal of Minister Olga Sanchez Cordero). Currently we have an area of 100 hectares with an installed capacity of 50  hectares for manufacturing. After Mexican Government will give cannabis a green light, we will start to produce it on our territory. Once we will select quality and we will destine it to the different markets that we already have in Canada and USA, making Agropot Oil (cannabis oil) to standardize its quality and be able to serve the different markets. We have the best certification in agricultural practices Primus GFS, which allows us to have the highest quality controls in safety and that are free of pesticides (the market requires it), so we will be training producers in plant management, flowering , pest control and environmentally friendly and innocuous techniques, since the market needs to be competitive to be competitive. After successful establishment of Cannabis + derivatives sales we are going to focus on strengthening our blockchain. Agrocoin blockchain must be mature because our net will be passing through enormous amount of data. By meaning of mature, we thinking about list of things: Instant Confirmations Network Security Nodes Enhanced Smart-Contracts Automated Blockchain Updgrading More on-chain data",0,0,0,blockchain+coin,GitHub

(default: bitcoind.pid)    -prune=<n>        Reduce storage requirements by enabling pruning (deleting) of old        blocks. This allows the pruneblockchain RPC to be called to        delete specific blocks, and enables automatic pruning of old        blocks if a target size in MiB is provided. This mode is        incompatible with -txindex and -rescan. Warning: Reverting this        setting requires re-downloading the entire blockchain. (default:        0 = disable pruning blocks, 1 = allow manual pruning via RPC,        >=550 = automatically prune block files to stay under the        specified target size in MiB)    -reindex        Rebuild chain state and block index from the blk*.dat files on disk    -reindex-chainstate        Rebuild chain state from the currently indexed blocks. When in pruning        mode or if blocks on disk might be corrupted, use full -reindex        instead.    -settings=<file>        Specify path to dynamic settings data file. Can be disabled with        -nosettings. File is written at runtime and not meant to be        edited by users (use bitcoin.conf instead for custom settings).        Relative paths will be prefixed by datadir location. (default:        settings.json)    -startupnotify=<cmd>        Execute command on startup.    -sysperms        Create new files with system default permissions, instead of umask 077        (only effective with disabled wallet functionality)    -txindex        Maintain a full transaction index, used by the getrawtransaction rpc        call (default: 0)    -version        Print version and exit  Connection options:    -addnode=<ip>        Add a node to connect to and attempt to keep the connection open (see        the `addnode` RPC command help for more info). This option can be        specified multiple times to add multiple nodes.    -asmap=<file>        Specify asn mapping used for bucketing of the peers (default:        ip_asn.map).

Use        [host]:port notation for IPv6. Append =onion to tag any incoming        connections to that address and port as incoming Tor connections        (default: 127.0.0.1:8334=onion, testnet: 127.0.0.1:18334=onion,        signet: 127.0.0.1:38334=onion, regtest: 127.0.0.1:18445=onion)    -connect=<ip>        Connect only to the specified node; -noconnect disables automatic        connections (the rules for this peer are the same as for        -addnode). This option can be specified multiple times to connect        to multiple nodes.    -discover        Discover own IP addresses (default: 1 when listening and no -externalip        or -proxy)    -dns        Allow DNS lookups for -addnode, -seednode and -connect (default: 1)    -dnsseed        Query for peer addresses via DNS lookup, if low on addresses (default: 1        unless -connect used)    -externalip=<ip>        Specify your own public address    -forcednsseed        Always query for peer addresses via DNS lookup (default: 0)    -listen        Accept connections from outside (default: 1 if no -proxy or -connect)    -listenonion        Automatically create Tor onion service (default: 1)    -maxconnections=<n>        Maintain at most <n> connections to peers (default: 125)    -maxreceivebuffer=<n>        Maximum per-connection receive buffer, <n>*1000 bytes (default: 5000)    -maxsendbuffer=<n>        Maximum per-connection send buffer, <n>*1000 bytes (default: 1000)    -maxtimeadjustment        Maximum allowed median peer time offset adjustment. Local perspective of        time may be influenced by peers forward or backward by this        amount. (default: 4200 seconds)    -maxuploadtarget=<n>        Tries to keep outbound traffic under the given target (in MiB per 24h).        Limit does not apply to peers with 'download' permission. 0 = no        limit (default: 0)    -networkactive        Enable all P2P network activity (default: 1). Can be changed by the        setnetworkactive RPC command    -onion=<ip:port>        Use separate SOCKS5 proxy to reach peers via Tor onion services, set        -noonion to disable (default: -proxy)    -onlynet=<net>        Make outgoing connections only through network <net> (ipv4, ipv6 or        onion). Incoming connections are not affected by this option.        This option can be specified multiple times to allow multiple        networks.    -peerblockfilters        Serve compact block filters to peers per BIP 157 (default: 0)    -peerbloomfilters        Support filtering of blocks and transaction with bloom filters (default:        0)    -permitbaremultisig        Relay non-P2SH multisig (default: 1)    -port=<port>        Listen for connections on <port>. Nodes not using the default ports        (default: 8333, testnet: 18333, signet: 38333, regtest: 18444)        are unlikely to get incoming connections.    -proxy=<ip:port>        Connect through SOCKS5 proxy, set -noproxy to disable (default:        disabled)    -proxyrandomize        Randomize credentials for every proxy connection. This enables Tor        stream isolation (default: 1)    -seednode=<ip>        Connect to a node to retrieve peer addresses, and disconnect. This        option can be specified multiple times to connect to multiple        nodes.    -timeout=<n>        Specify connection timeout in milliseconds (minimum: 1, default: 5000)    -torcontrol=<ip>:<port>        Tor control port to use if onion listening enabled (default:        127.0.0.1:9051)    -torpassword=<pass>        Tor control port password (default: empty)    -upnp        Use UPnP to map the listening port (default: 0)    -whitebind=<[permissions@]addr>        Bind to the given address and add permission flags to the peers        connecting to it. Use [host]:port notation for IPv6. Allowed        permissions: bloomfilter (allow requesting BIP37 filtered blocks        and transactions), noban (do not ban for misbehavior; implies        download), forcerelay (relay transactions that are already in the        mempool; implies relay), relay (relay even in -blocksonly mode,        and unlimited transaction announcements), mempool (allow        requesting BIP35 mempool contents), download (allow getheaders        during IBD, no disconnect after maxuploadtarget limit), addr        (responses to GETADDR avoid hitting the cache and contain random        records with the most up-to-date info). Specify multiple        permissions separated by commas (default:        download,noban,mempool,relay). Can be specified multiple times.    -whitelist=<[permissions@]IP address or network>        Add permission flags to the peers connecting from the given IP address        (e.g. 1.2.3.4) or CIDR-notated network (e.g. 1.2.3.0/24). Uses        the same permissions as -whitebind. Can be specified multiple        times.  Wallet options:    -addresstype        What type of addresses to use (""legacy"", ""p2sh-segwit"", or ""bech32"",        default: ""bech32"")    -avoidpartialspends        Group outputs by address, selecting all or none, instead of selecting on        a per-output basis. Privacy is improved as an address is only        used once (unless someone sends to it after spending from it),        but may result in slightly higher fees as suboptimal coin        selection may result due to the added limitation (default: 0        (always enabled for wallets with ""avoid_reuse"" enabled))    -changetype        What type of change to use (""legacy"", ""p2sh-segwit"", or ""bech32"").        Default is same as -addresstype, except when        -addresstype=p2sh-segwit a native segwit output is used when        sending to a native segwit address)    -disablewallet        Do not load the wallet and disable wallet RPC calls    -discardfee=<amt>        The fee rate (in BTC/kB) that indicates your tolerance for discarding        change by adding it to the fee (default: 0.0001). Note: An output        is discarded if it is dust at this rate, but we will always        discard up to the dust relay fee and a discard fee above that is        limited by the fee estimate for the longest target    -fallbackfee=<amt>        A fee rate (in BTC/kB) that will be used when fee estimation has        insufficient data. 0 to entirely disable the fallbackfee feature.        (default: 0.00)    -keypool=<n>        Set key pool size to <n> (default: 1000). Warning: Smaller sizes may        increase the risk of losing funds when restoring from an old        backup, if none of the addresses in the original keypool have        been used.    -maxapsfee=<n>        Spend up to this amount in additional (absolute) fees (in BTC) if it        allows the use of partial spend avoidance (default: 0.00)    -mintxfee=<amt>        Fees (in BTC/kB) smaller than this are considered zero fee for        transaction creation (default: 0.00001)    -paytxfee=<amt>        Fee (in BTC/kB) to add to transactions you send (default: 0.00)    -rescan        Rescan the block chain for missing wallet transactions on startup    -spendzeroconfchange        Spend unconfirmed change when sending transactions (default: 1)    -txconfirmtarget=<n>        If paytxfee is not set, include enough fee so transactions begin        confirmation on average within n blocks (default: 6)    -wallet=<path>        Specify wallet path to load at startup. Can be used multiple times to        load multiple wallets. Path is to a directory containing wallet        data and log files. If the path is not absolute, it is        interpreted relative to <walletdir>. This only loads existing        wallets and does not create new ones. For backwards compatibility        this also accepts names of existing top-level data files in        <walletdir>.    -walletbroadcast        Make the wallet broadcast transactions (default: 1)    -walletdir=<dir>        Specify directory to hold wallets (default: <datadir>/wallets if it        exists, otherwise <datadir>)    -walletnotify=<cmd>        Execute command when a wallet transaction changes. %s in cmd is replaced        by TxID and %w is replaced by wallet name. %w is not currently        implemented on windows. On systems where %w is supported, it        should NOT be quoted because this would break shell escaping used        to invoke the command.    -walletrbf        Send transactions with full-RBF opt-in enabled (RPC only, default: 0)  ZeroMQ notification options:    -zmqpubhashblock=<address>        Enable publish hash block in <address>    -zmqpubhashblockhwm=<n>        Set publish hash block outbound message high water mark (default: 1000)    -zmqpubhashtx=<address>        Enable publish hash transaction in <address>    -zmqpubhashtxhwm=<n>        Set publish hash transaction outbound message high water mark (default:        1000)    -zmqpubrawblock=<address>        Enable publish raw block in <address>    -zmqpubrawblockhwm=<n>        Set publish raw block outbound message high water mark (default: 1000)    -zmqpubrawtx=<address>        Enable publish raw transaction in <address>    -zmqpubrawtxhwm=<n>        Set publish raw transaction outbound message high water mark (default:        1000)    -zmqpubsequence=<address>        Enable publish hash block and tx sequence in <address>    -zmqpubsequencehwm=<n>        Set publish hash sequence message high water mark (default: 1000)  Debugging/Testing options:    -debug=<category>        Output debugging information (default: -nodebug, supplying <category> is        optional). If <category> is not supplied or if <category> = 1,        output all debugging information. <category> can be: net, tor,        mempool, http, bench, zmq, walletdb, rpc, estimatefee, addrman,        selectcoins, reindex, cmpctblock, rand, prune, proxy, mempoolrej,        libevent, coindb, qt, leveldb, validation.    -debugexclude=<category>        Exclude debugging information for a category. Can be used in conjunction        with -debug=1 to output debug logs for all categories except one        or more specified categories.    -help-debug        Print help message with debugging options and exit    -logips        Include IP addresses in debug output (default: 0)    -logthreadnames        Prepend debug output with name of the originating thread (only available        on platforms supporting thread_local) (default: 0)    -logtimestamps        Prepend debug output with timestamp (default: 1)    -maxtxfee=<amt>        Maximum total fees (in BTC) to use in a single wallet transaction;        setting this too low may abort large transactions (default: 0.10)    -printtoconsole        Send trace/debug info to console (default: 1 when no -daemon. To disable        logging to file, set -nodebuglogfile)    -shrinkdebugfile        Shrink debug.log file on client startup (default: 1 when no -debug)    -uacomment=<cmt>        Append comment to the user agent string  Chain selection options:    -chain=<chain>        Use the chain <chain> (default: main). Allowed values: main, test,        signet, regtest    -signet        Use the signet chain. Equivalent to -chain=signet. Note that the network        is defined by the -signetchallenge parameter    -signetchallenge        Blocks must satisfy the given script to be considered valid (only for        signet networks; defaults to the global default signet test        network challenge)    -signetseednode        Specify a seed node for the signet network, in the hostname[:port]        format, e.g. sig.net:1234 (may be used multiple times to specify        multiple seed nodes; defaults to the global default signet test        network seed node(s))    -testnet        Use the test chain. Equivalent to -chain=test.  Node relay options:    -bytespersigop        Equivalent bytes per sigop in transactions for relay and mining        (default: 20)    -datacarrier        Relay and mine data carrier transactions (default: 1)    -datacarriersize        Maximum size of data in data carrier transactions we relay and mine        (default: 83)    -minrelaytxfee=<amt>        Fees (in BTC/kB) smaller than this are considered zero fee for relaying,        mining and transaction creation (default: 0.00001)    -whitelistforcerelay        Add 'forcerelay' permission to whitelisted inbound peers with default        permissions. This will relay transactions even if the        transactions were already in the mempool. (default: 0)    -whitelistrelay        Add 'relay' permission to whitelisted inbound peers with default        permissions. This will accept relayed transactions even when not        relaying transactions (default: 1)  Block creation options:    -blockmaxweight=<n>        Set maximum BIP141 block weight (default: 3996000)    -blockmintxfee=<amt>        Set lowest fee rate (in BTC/kB) for transactions to be included in block        creation.

Valid for <ip> are a        single IP (e.g. 1.2.3.4), a network/netmask (e.g.        1.2.3.4/255.255.255.0) or a network/CIDR (e.g. 1.2.3.4/24). This        option can be specified multiple times    -rpcauth=<userpw>        Username and HMAC-SHA-256 hashed password for JSON-RPC connections. The        field <userpw> comes in the format: <USERNAME>:<SALT>$<HASH>. A        canonical python script is included in share/rpcauth. The client        then connects normally using the        rpcuser=<USERNAME>/rpcpassword=<PASSWORD> pair of arguments. This        option can be specified multiple times    -rpcbind=<addr>[:port]        Bind to given address to listen for JSON-RPC connections. Do not expose        the RPC server to untrusted networks such as the public internet!        This option is ignored unless -rpcallowip is also passed. Port is        optional and overrides -rpcport. Use [host]:port notation for        IPv6. This option can be specified multiple times (default:        127.0.0.1 and ::1 i.e., localhost)    -rpccookiefile=<loc>        Location of the auth cookie.

The        field <whitelist> comes in the format: <USERNAME>:<rpc 1>,<rpc        2>,...,<rpc n>. If multiple whitelists are set for a given user,        they are set-intersected. See -rpcwhitelistdefault documentation        for information on default whitelist behavior.    -rpcwhitelistdefault        Sets default behavior for rpc whitelisting. Unless rpcwhitelistdefault        is set to 0, if any -rpcwhitelist is set, the rpc server acts as        if all rpc users are subject to empty-unless-otherwise-specified        whitelists. If rpcwhitelistdefault is set to 1 and no        -rpcwhitelist is set, rpc server acts as if all rpc users are        subject to empty whitelists.    -server        Accept command line and JSON-RPC commands  ~ $",0,3,0,blockchain+coin,GitHub
