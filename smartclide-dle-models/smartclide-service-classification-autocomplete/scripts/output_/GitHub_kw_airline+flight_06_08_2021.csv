52,Concorde,https://github.com/concorde-speed/Concorde.git,"Date of Concorde In January of the year 1976 after 29 years of the first to penetrate to the speed of sound military aircraft jet - Two Concord took off together at the same time, one from London and one from Paris, the first airline service ultrasound for travelers. The aircraft Almottaghtan has looked towards the west as if they were Tgaraan - even Tsabakan - the sun. Where they arrived as if they did not Taathrca, in terms of time, in a new event launches air transport stage supersonic passenger wealthy people who do not allow them to narrow their time to stay in the air for long periods. How the project began and evolved, and how the outcome of the remaining Concorde lounges to museums ... This is what Santapah in the following lines: The emergence of the Concorde The deal ""supersonic"" between England and France was signed in 1962, for the design and construction of the first civilian supersonic plane manufactured by Airbus for them. After long years of arduous efforts and research strenuous, in addition to more than 5,000 hours in the air tunnels, proved to be a form of equity Almstrq with the body long cylinder for aircraft relatively large passengers, it is the best form executable command and control speeds ultrasound. The first two aircraft of this type making and Tjeribhma in 1969, and since then about 20 aircraft of this model, called the ""Concord"" was produced (the only civilian aircraft that exceed the speed of sound speed), and who serve in the British Airways and Air France in income 1976, the rate of seven aircraft of the British lines and five lines in French. The first fly line is the London - Singapore via Bahrain. In 1976 received Bahrain Airport very important event, which is to start regular flights between Bahrain and London, the fastest of the British Airways sound Concorde, the airport first and the only one who was receiving this type of aircraft in the Middle East, given that the Concorde need to Airports women with special specifications, so they need to take-off and landing runways longer than the regular airports runways, and the noise from the power of their engines leads to smash windows of buildings ordinary airports, and the speed has a crush Madarjha. What Concorde is distinct from other aircraft?Characterized by Concorde slim form in the form of a triangle (delta). And fly faster and higher than other aircraft altitudes, using the ""upward vortex"" method to accomplish extraordinary mission. For example, while the ""Boeing 747"" aircraft speed, better known as ""jumbo"" around 900 km / h (about 84.0 Mach) at an altitude of 35 thousand feet, the Concorde fly quickly 2172 km / h (Mach 2) at an altitude of 60 thousand Foot. It is known that Almaj is the real rate of speed compared to the speed of sound, and is equivalent to an average of 1225 kilometers per hour, so that the speed of sound changes with temperature change, which moves rapidly 1190 km / h at sea level, but it drops to 1060 km / h at an altitude of 36,000 feet above the ground, where the air temperature drops. Because the Place de la Concorde to fly faster than the speed of sound, they differ from the rest of the aircraft on several characteristics. First, in terms of the flow of the fuselage, where you need to own dynamic shape to face severe air resistance at these high speeds, and it is achieved by taking the body form of a high pin tapered, triangular wings tilted back, my head and a tail, and an introduction brushes can be moved to the bottom of takeoffs and landings to be able to see the pilot of the corridor, to the top during flight to improve the flow of the fuselage. Amounting to 83 feet and 8 inches tall plane wings in the company ""Oarossbesiak"" has produced and supplied surfaces work together Kdvh depth, also works differentially Kjnahat. There is no tip installed inside the concavity of the wing, but no spire parties descend and spin at the same time. The second difference is related engines, where the Concorde's engines proved directly in the wings to avoid the use of any parts of the conductive would crash at high speeds, and the engine fitted with a special friendly hotel to exploit the resulting exhaust for initial combustion cycle combustion again mixing with more new fuel to increase efficient engines and power, where this process provides the engine in the final stage of heating fuel for the production of the required additional power for takeoff and the transition from one phase to the heating of supersonic flight, allowing aircraft takeoff speed of 360 km / h. The useful load carried by the Concorde's less than a third of what was done other than in the weight of the jets under the sound, so it was no reduction in the efficiency of the engine, it is actually the difference between profit and loss. Every Concorde has supplied four-engine aircraft, ""Snecma Olympus DS 593,"" the momentum of 17259 kg. The company ""Rolls Royce"" design engines, which provided all Dagtin separate engine in order to fuel economy. Each engine and also provided additional Aq. Engine reverse payment system is also equipped. On the other hand, the Concorde is distinct from other aircraft fuel tanks and the presence of more and larger, with four engines burn a tremendous amount of kerosene has more than 25 thousand liters per flight hour. However, the fuel tanks lead a purpose whatever else, which is to maintain the equilibrium plane, where the center to raise the plane travels at high speeds for its center of gravity and then you move amounts of fuel between private additional tanks at the front of the plane and the rear to offset that effect, and returned those quantities at low speed in preparation for landing to bring the situation back to its origin. For example, a flight plan requires the distance between Paris and the French coast on the Atlantic equator at less than the speed of sound speed is determined to 0.93 Mach, to be at the height of about 9000 meters, after which the plane begins to jump quickly to reach the speed of take-off and altitude wanted, it performs speed between the two situations difference to a change in the dynamics of the plane to move from the airline less than the sound quickly to other higher speed of sound, and to overcome this situation, the transfer of fuel in an aircraft using a payment of reservoirs located in the introduction to the reservoirs in the system rear. During the transitional situation between the two modes of ex (between Mach 1 and Mach 1.6) increases air resistance sharply, and at this moment is to break the sound barrier. Once access to 1.7 Mach the captain to stop the internal combustion process, after more than a very plane speed of up to Mach 2, or 2200 km / h, more than twice the speed of sound, which represent the target aircraft speed, while the estimated target of 16000 and 18000 meters altitude. But when approaching landing, the fuel will move to the front of the plane, and the concomitant rise in the plane's nose, to land the plane in a scene it looks like a bird landing on the surface of the water. Finally remains the difference in the fuselage coating, where the Concorde is exposed at high speeds to a very large rise in body temperature as a result of increased friction of air molecules, so they coated special material properties and reflective stronger than those in the other aircraft, capable of dispersing such high temperatures . The fuselage itself is made from a special metal is characterized by a greater capacity to withstand the heat and stress resistance resulting from inflation fuselage resulting in turn from high temperature. The speed of the plane have been identified in the horizontal flight Mach 2.2, which is just before the thermal barrier (which is the speed at which if exceeded temperature increases dramatically), but it has identified the chronological age of the structure of 60,000 flight hours. And making the structure of the aluminum-alloy steel by thermal changes from -35 degrees to +120 degrees, as the flight above the speed limit of the plane requires that the structure is made with a mixture of steel and titanium, which means more weight. Fly the Concorde at the highest altitudes of 50,000 feet, where the air is equal to a tenth of what Tsawiyeh at sea density, and the temperature at that very low altitude, and despite all this work ultrasonic motors with high efficiency. According to reports of the pilots can handle the plane easily. The acceleration of the aircraft and transit speeds TransitionAnd what is characterized travel Balkounkord from other aircraft? Accommodate the Concorde for a hundred passengers and crew consists of a pilot and a flight engineer and his assistant in addition to the six hosts. When quitting, the passenger feels strongly pay back as a result of the launch aircraft from sleep to the speed of 362 km / h in just 30 seconds, which is called the Earth's gravitational force, and quickly reach the maximum height of the plane and penetrate the speed of the sound barrier. In all the flight times travelers can know the speed, through a private display panel installed in front of them, and are entitled to see the curve of the globe and Northern Lights because of the high altitude, which is flying the plane. Travelers can also watch the first layer colors of the atmosphere, where the height of the plane boundary between the first two Tbaktah. It takes Atlantic crossing Balkounkord three and a half hours only, while the that time about nine hours in the other underneath the aircraft sounds. And up the Concorde passengers who starts his journey from London at ten thirty in the morning to New York at nine thirty in the morning, before the date of its launch radios. This of course does not mean a retreat in time, but due to time differences and the short flight time! Over the last quarter-century, Concorde was the five weekly flights between Paris and New York in a record speed of less than 4 hours, at which time it cut the best of conventional aircraft, the same distance in 8 hours. He was landing at Kennedy Airport (according to US time) at eight in the morning, and exiting back to France at the eleventh hour before noon, where businessmen French used to negotiate with the Americans their customers at the airport Salons, without having to go to the business and financial district in Manhattan, and then return to Paris the same day.  And to what the fate of the Concorde? I tried both the US and Soviet governments (former) develop similar Balkounkord aircraft, but those attempts ended in retreat, either because the magnitude of the required expenditures on the American side, or the occurrence of accidents due to human error on the Soviet side. Some of these Soviet aircraft had stayed (model ""T U-144""), as amended to date, but used in air mail services, also placed some of them in museums, while one of them devoted to project Russian joint US. And remained the Concorde, solo travel of passengers faster than the speed of sound even temporarily suspended service to make adjustments after the accident led to an explosion killed one of them and all of them were. In addition, the high run that made the ticket price between Paris, London and New York round-trip $ 10,000, which led to limited use of the rich and famous costs, as well as what caused the noise and pollution, suffered Concorde most suffered from weak passenger demand for flights, in Following the incident, which came under the air France one in Paris in July 2000 to a near Charles de Gaulle airport hotels, which led to the deaths of 109 people on board and four people on the ground. Consequently After some major attended by experts and investigators, scientists, lawyers, artists, religious leaders and industrialists from different generations, between believers technology and Muslims in terms of authority to the modern age and among those who believe that it is necessary to rein in scientific progress and the development of ethical and legal controls him, took the final decision to stop flights Place de la Concorde. In July of 2003, tens of thousands of lovers of the Concorde gathered along the road to Heathrow Airport in the fog of London, the capital, in a bid farewell final before this model withdraw aircraft from service, after it made its first commercial flight in 1976. This has three Concorde planes reviewing the air before landing at Heathrow Airport in a reference to the termination of commercial flights known aircraft at supersonic speed. And charged the British Airways Concorde plane carrying 100 special guest at the final flight, which launched from Kennedy Airport in New York towards London, penetrated the sound barrier for the last time. Upon entering British airspace acceded Two Concord British Airways, one coming from the city of Edinburgh in Scotland, and the other from the Bay of Biscay west of France. Lovers plane Odalla in July of 2003 in Paris, as well as a pool, in the last trip out between Paris and New York, after a 27-year-old was cut where the distance between the two cities in a matter of three hours and a half. Where he lined up more than 250 workers from the maintenance workers bodyguards honor of the plane at Charles de Gaulle airport, with thousands of French gathered on the edge of the airport to see the plane taking off, holding a banner reading ""We love you, Concord."" The French lines: that the plane Concorde belong to the humanitarian aviation heritage and must therefore provide an opportunity for more people to see it, and added that it would apply to all of the fleet of Air France Concorde aircraft, which will be displayed every aircraft in museums in France, Germany and the United States, such as the Museum aviation and aerospace in the suburb of ""Le Bourget"" Paris, the Museum of Aviation near the Scottish capital ""Edinburgh"". Parts of the plane crashed as sold at Christie's for souvenirs to those who died to travel out, varied between the nose of the plane and the door of cabin leadership and a seat pilot and antenna radar warning in which the two motors of the engines and parts of the dashboard to the instructions and cutlery dishwasher ceramic spoons and silver booklet, worth total amounted to 3.29 million euros, went in favor of a charitable institution of the air France is working in the field of care for the poor children.

Higher productivity and effective management     Security and protection of confidential data.     Transaction management and routing.  All user/agents are allocated  a SINE code, which is used during sine-on and then appended to all transactions carried out by the agent for security purpose . Different security levels may be assigned so that different agents can access different areas of the system and also different records in the case where a travel agent is only allowed to review PNR’s  that have been created by that agency.  Flights may be entered as far ahead as required without limitation using the flight inventory GUI. Native transactions support reservations up to 1 year ahead.

Airlines belong to three greatest airline alliance, Star Alliance, Skyteam, Oneworld, transported more than two-thirds of total scheduled traffic in the world. In this project we analysis the network of three airline alliances. We define airports as node and flights between airport 1 and airport 2 as edge in our network. We use degree centrality to measure each node in each alliance. We also perform community detection to compare the difference across three alliance. Combining the latest news that China Southern Airline, the largest air carrier, will leave Skyteam in January 2019 and might join Oneworld, we will discover the network and analyze the impact on Skyteam and Oneworld.",1,1,1,airline+flight,GitHub

The project consists of a SQL server that acts as the database for the project. My motivation for the project came from my enthusiasm and strong urge to learn PHP and HTML which is one of the fastest-growing technologies in today’s world. The Airline Reservation System project mainly consists of two types of users. The users who access the information provided by the website and the administrator who modifies and views the information available on the website. All the data needed for the application is stored in the form of tables in the SQL server. The report contains the details of all the tasks carried out during the entire software development life cycle of the Airline Reservation Project. This document depicts all the details of the project starting from the project design to testing. The project is done using a local server –XAMPP. ,1,0,1,airline+flight,GitHub

Inheritance is a means for incrementally building new types from an existing parent type by inheriting, modifying, or adding to both the existing components and operations of the parent type. Inheritance greatly supports reuse in the software development process. Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) is a technique that provides a friendly environment for users. Students will practice these techniques in this project. Project Assignment Design and implement a ticket reservation system for United Airline. The United Airline has two airplanes that fly between Greensboro and Newark every day. Flight 310 departures from Greensboro at 8:00 AM and arrive Newark at 9:30 AM. Flight 320 departures from Newark at 1:59 PM and arrives Greensboro at 3:29PM. Each airplane provides three types of airplane tickets. Economy class allows a passenger to select a window or aisle seat. Business class allows a passenger to select a window or an aisle seat and select a snack. The snack can be cookies or peanuts. First class provides all services Business class provided; pluses a passenger can have a free taxi. The price of an Economic class ticket is $300. The price of a Business class ticket is 50% more than the price of an economic class ticket. The price of a First-class ticket is double of the price of a business class ticket. This system should allow an agent to input a customer name, starting city and destination, flight number, class selected, departure date and time. It will display all information on the screen. Use single inheritance to implement this system.",1,0,1,airline+flight,GitHub

In the year 2007 alone, airline delays cost the US Economy 31.2 Billion dollars. To better understand the trend for departure in different airline carriers we decided to explore deeper with a focus on their delays based on various time series forecasting models. Aviation daily data were used in the analysis and model development. By performing a cluster analysis of all the carriers, time series analysis was carried on for any particular trend or seasonality and later for forecasting future departure delays different forecasting models are studied and validated.

849,COMP360-Flight-Ticket-Reservation,https://github.com/shayla11/COMP360-Flight-Ticket-Reservation.git," Objective: An object-oriented programming language supports abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. Inheritance is a means for incrementally building new types from an existing superclass type by inheriting, modifying, or adding to both the existing components and operations of the superclass type. Inheritance greatly supports reuse in the software development process. Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) is another technique that provides a friendly environment for users. Students will practice these techniques in this project.  Project Assignment  Design and implement an airplane ticket reservation system for NewBorn Airline. The NewBorn Airline has two airplanes that fly between Greensboro and Queens every day. One departures at 10:00 Am and arrive Queens at 11:30 AM. Another departures at 2:00 PM and arrives Queens at 3:30PM. Each airplane provides three types of airplane tickets. Economy class allows a passenger to select a window or aisle seat. Business class allows a passenger to select a window or an aisle seat, and select a snack. The snack can be cookies or nuts. First class provides all services Business class provided; pluses a passenger can have a bottle wine. This system should allow an agent to input a customer name, starting city and destination, flight number, class selected, departure date and time. It will display all information on the screen. Use single inheritance to implement this system.",0,0,0,airline+flight,GitHub

851,Flight-Reservation-Website,https://github.com/SuyashBanzal/Flight-Reservation-Website.git,".  In this project, our aim is to find optimal ways to go to the place where customers want to go. One of the ways is that customers reach destination in shortest time period. If customers concern about time, money is unimportant for them. Another one is that customers reach destination by spending lowest fee. In this situation, if customers concern about money, time is unimportant for them. Optimality guarantees lowest fee or shortest time.       In the final part of the project, steps of product are finished by us. Product is made up of associated documentation and computer programs. We introduce characteristics of project like defining requirements, making prototype for customers and scheduling a project. Secondly, our software is a web application. Internet programming is mostly used in our project. Customers must use internet for reaching our system. When we look at computer programs, they include databases, collection of programs which are related to finding optimal paths with algorithms, graphical user interface for visual projection. There are two databases. First one of them keeps flight information about airline companies. Flight information is planes arrival and departure times. Second database keeps user information. Why it can keep? Because, users are taking information about promotions and opportunities by registering themselves to this accounting system. Also, we and airline companies know who our customers are by keeping their information. Another one of the collection of computer programs finds optimal way to go to the place where customers want to go with using optimizations algorithms. In the web browser, user chooses one way to go to the place. When user chooses, algorithms start to work at the back side of the product. Then, it returns answer for what user wants. Final part of the computer programs is graphical user interface (GUI). Interface provides environment for users and developers to communicate each other. Users buy and reserve tickets by this interface. In addition, it is also web-based interface.           Finally, we explain our product characteristics. Our software product is a web-based application. Internet programming, database and algorithm are used in the product. At the bottom parts of this documentation, we mention about external interface requirements, software product features, software product attributes and database requirements.

852,Douglas-Dc3,https://github.com/swampmo/Douglas-Dc3.git,"The Douglas DC-3 is a fixed-wing propeller-driven airliner. Its cruise speed (207 mph or 333 km/h) and range (1,500 mi or 2,400 km) revolutionized air transport in the 1930s and 1940s. Its lasting effect on the airline industry and World War II makes it one of the most significant transport aircraft ever made.  The DC-3 was a twin-engine metal monoplane, developed as a larger, improved 14-bed sleeper version of the Douglas DC-2. It had many exceptional qualities compared to previous aircraft. It was fast, had a good range and could operate from short runways. Its construction was all-metal. It was reliable and easy to maintain and carried passengers in greater comfort. Before the war it pioneered many air travel routes. It was able to cross the continental United States, making transcontinental flights and worldwide flights possible, and is considered the first airliner that could make money by carrying passengers alone.[4]  Civil DC-3 production ended in 1942 with 607 aircraft being produced. However, together with its military derivative, the C-47 Skytrain (designated the Dakota in British Royal Air Force (RAF) service), and with Russian- and Japanese-built versions, over 16,000 were built. Following the Second World War, the airliner market was flooded with surplus C-47s and other ex-military transport aircraft, and Douglas' attempts to produce an upgraded DC-3 were a failure due to cost.  While the DC-3 was soon made redundant on main routes by more advanced types such as the Douglas DC-6 and Lockheed Constellation, the design continued to prove exceptionally adaptable and useful. Large numbers continue to see service in a wide variety of niche roles well into the 21st century. In 2013 it was estimated that approximately 2,000 DC-3s and military derivatives were still flying, a testament to the durability of the design",0,1,0,airline+flight,GitHub
