From here onwards you'll learn everything by example, by analysing and exploiting computer systems such as networks, servers, clients, websites .....etc, so we'll never have any boring dry theoretical lectures.  The course is divided into a number of sections, each section covers a penetration testing / hacking field, in each of these sections you'll first learn how the target system works, the weaknesses of this system, and how to practically exploit theses weaknesses and hack into it, not only that but you'll also learn how to secure this system from the discussed attacks. This course will take you from a beginner to a more advanced level by the time you finish, you will have knowledge about most penetration testing fields.  The course is divided into four main sections:  1. Network Hacking - This section will teach you how to test the security of networks, both wired and wireless. First, you will learn some basic network terminology, how networks work, and how devices communicate with each other. Then it will branch into three sub sections:  Pre-connection attacks: in this subsection you'll learn what can you do before even connecting to a network, and even before having internet access; you'll start by learning how to gather information about the networks around you, discover the devices connected to them, and how to control connections around you (ie: deny/allow devices from connecting to networks) even without knowing the password of the target network.  Gaining Access: Now that you gathered information about the networks around you, in this subsection you will learn how to crack the key and get the password to your target network weather it uses WEP, WPA or even WPA2.  Post Connection attacks: Now that you have the key, you can connect to the target network, in this subsection you will learn a number of powerful techniques that allow you to gather comprehensive information about the connected devices, see anything they do on the internet (such as login information, passwords, visited urls, images, videos ....etc), redirect requests, inject evil code in loaded pages and much more! All the attacks here work against both wireless and wired networks. You will also learn how to create a fake WiFi network, attract users to connect to it and use all of the above techniques against the connected clients.  2. Gaining Access - In this section you will learn two main approaches to gain full control or hack computer systems:  Server Side Attacks: In this subsection you will learn how to gain full access to computer systems without the need for user interaction. You will learn how to gather useful information about a target computer system such as its operating system, open ports, installed services, then you'll learn how to use this information to discover weaknesses and vulnerabilitiesand exploit them to gain full control over the target. Finally you will learn how to generate different types of reports for your discoveries.  Client Side Attacks - If the target system does not contain any weaknesses then the only way to gain access to it is by interacting with the users, in this subsection you'll learn how to get the target user to install a backdoor on their system without even realising, this is done by hijacking updatesor backdoornig downloadeds on the fly. Not only that but you'll also learn how to create trojans by backdooring normal files (such as an image or a pdf) and use social engineering to deliver this trojan to the target, to do this you'll learn how to spoof emails so they appear as if they're sent from the target's friend, boss or any email account they're likely to interact with.  3. Post Exploitation - In this section you will learn how to interact with the systems you compromised so far. You’ll learn how to access the file system (read/write/upload/execute), maintain your access, spy on the target and even use the target computer as a pivot to hack other computer systems.  4. Website / Web Application Hacking - In this section you will learn how websites work, how to gather information about a target website (such as website owner, server location, used technologies ....etc) and how to discover and exploit the following dangerous vulnerabilities to hack into websites:",50,21,50,weather,GitHub

From there we run image processing at the edge on these IoT device using OpenCV and TensorFlow to determine attributes and image analytics.   A pache MiniFi coordinates running these Python scripts and decides when and what to send from that analysis and the image to a remote Apache NiFi server for additional processing.     At the Apache NiFi cluster in the cluster it routes the images to one processing path and the JSON encoded metadata to another flow.    The JSON data (with it's schema referenced from a central Schema Registry) is routed and routed using Record Processing and SQL, this data in enriched and augment before conversion to AVRO to be send via Apache Kafka to SAM.   Streaming Analytics Manager then does deeper processing on this stream and others including weather and twitter to determine what should be done on this data.

He looks down at a BRACELET (a manly one) on his right arm.       It's a silver band with a FLASHING red letter ""U"".                                  UBERMAN (CONT'D)                 Looks like Roxanne's in trouble                 again.              Uberman leaps off the building and into the air. His cape       gracefully flows in the breeze behind him as he shoots off       into the distance like a speeding bullet.              EXT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - ESTABLISHING SHOT              Grime and moss decorate the outside of this long abandoned       building overlooking the COAST. Once a place of knowledge and       wonder - now home to a great evil.              INT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY              The inside is in complete contrast to the exterior. The huge       hall with a GIANT TELESCOPE teems with advanced ELECTRONIC       EQUIPMENT. Computers, monitors and machines which do not have       an obvious function FLASH and HUM.              A STEEL DOOR slides open, revealing the subject of our story       MASTER MIND - a villainous sight to behold. His FACE IS       INEXPLICABLY LIGHT BLUE, topped by an OVERSIZED, MUSHROOM-       SHAPED HEAD with a CIRCULAR PATCH OF WHITE HAIR ON TOP.              He's dressed in the kind of costume only a super villain       could pull off: a PURPLE JUMPSUIT AND BLACK BOOT ENSEMBLE       WITH A GIANT GREEN ""M"" ON THE CHEST. His right hand, hanging       at his side, is a METAL GAUNTLET WITH THREE SHORT SPIKES       PROTRUDING BETWEEN HIS KNUCKLES.              Master Mind begins to survey the room with his TWO       PERMANENTLY ARCHED EYEBROWS.              A man dressed as ALBERT EINSTEIN is busy ranting to two other       men. One, a hulking brute, is dressed as LEONARDO DA VINCI.       The other, a small intellectual-type carrying a clip-board,       is dressed as the philosopher PLATO.                                  EINSTEIN                 I hate the outfits. I mean, I get                 it: we're all supposed to be                 ""masterminds"" - very clever.                           (MORE)                                                                 3.                           EINSTEIN(cont'd)                 I just feel stupid. I mean, what                 the hell did Einstein really do                 anyway?                                  PLATO                 Theory of relativity.              Einstein starts feverishly scratching his side.                                  EINSTEIN                 Well, you'd think he'd invent a                 wool sweater that didn't itch so                 much.              Da Vinci and Plato's eyes suddenly grow with concern as they       see Master Mind walk up behind Einstein.              Einstein notices his colleague's staring over his right       shoulder and turns around.              He turns around and Master Mind SEIZES HIM BY HIS THROAT with       his metal gauntlet.                                  MASTER MIND                 The real Einstein once said, ""God                 does not play dice with the world.""                 He was right, because the world is                 MY dice. Is that understood?                                  DA VINCI & PLATO                 Sir! Yes, sir!                                  EINSTEIN                     (gasping for air)                 Yes, sir.              Master Mind undoes his grip on Einstein's throat.                                  MASTER MIND                 Alright, then - clean slate. Do we                 have the girl?                                  DA VINCI                 Yes, sir. She fell into our trap                 just like you knew she would.                                  MASTER MIND                 Reporters are a curious lot, and                 easily manipulated.              He quickly checks his physique in a GIANT MIRROR, adjusts his       posture and sucks in his gut.                                                                   4.                                                MASTER MIND                 Alright, let's not keep the lady                 waiting.              MOMENTS LATER              Da Vinci escorts a BLINDFOLDED and bound woman, ROXANNE       RITCHI, to the back of the room where Plato and Einstein are       standing guard over a large BLACK SWIVEL-CHAIR facing away       from us.              She pulls free of Da Vinci's grasp and waits for him to undo       the blindfold.              Her face uncovered, we finally see Roxanne's striking       features - all of which seem overshadowed by piercing eyes       that seem more put off by the situation than afraid of it.                                  MASTER MIND (O.S.)                 Miss Ritchi, we meet again.              The chair turns menacingly slow, finally revealing Master       Mind.                                  ROXANNE                 You didn't need to turn around like                 that. I can recognize the stench of                 failure.              Master Mind unleashes a wicked laugh.                                  MASTER MIND                 I trust you gentlemen know the very                 sassy Roxanne Ritchi, highly                 regarded investigative journalist                 who some say has a more than                 friendly relationship with our                 super powered foe Uberman. And Miss                 Ritchi, I trust you've already met                 my new crew: The Mad Geniuses!              Roxanne gives Einstein a once over.                                  ROXANNE                 Looks like a real group of winners.                 At the risk of sounding cliche',                 you'll never get away with this.                                  MASTER MIND                 In a way, I already have.              Roxanne unleashes an exhausted SIGH.                                                                5.                                                ROXANNE                 We go through this every time. You                 kidnap me to get to Uberman, he                 immediately finds your hideout,                 escapes whatever lame trap you've                 come up with, and takes you and                 your cronies to jail. I propose we                 just save everybody some heartache                 this time by YOU letting me go, and                 ME forgetting this whole thing ever                 happened?                                  MASTER MIND                 What about my revenge?                                  ROXANNE                 We can say it was wasting                 everyone's time.                                  MASTER MIND                 You have a wicked tongue. I hope                 you rid yourself of that when                 you're my queen.              Roxanne unleashes a snort-filled laugh.                                  ROXANNE                 I'm sorry. What makes you think I                 would want to be your queen?                                  MASTER MIND                 Power corrupts absolutely, Miss                 Ritchi. And when I have ultimate                 power over this city, I have                 absolutely every intention of                 corrupting you with it.                                  PLATO                 Sir!              Master Mind turns to Plato who's now standing at a computer       terminal.                                  MASTER MIND                     (annoyed)                 What is it!?              EXT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY              Uberman flies toward the Observatory like a rocket.                                                                   6.                                   INT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY              Uberman crashes through the wall to the room we were just in.       He looks around, but there's suddenly NOT A SOUL IN SIGHT.                                                               CUT TO:              EXT.

HYDROFOIL CONTROL ROOM - DAY              Machines, cables and terminals criss-cross the craft's main       bridge. Through the enormous surrounding windows we can see       the observatory shrinking in the distance.              Master Mind watches Uberman on a small TV monitor as the hero       intently searches his hideout.                                  UBERMAN                     (on monitor)                 Master Mind!              INT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY              Uberman throws up his arms in frustration when suddenly -                                  MASTER MIND (O.S.)                 Over here, old friend.              He turns to see a FAMILIAR BLUE FACE OF EVIL ON A GIANT       SCREEN.                                   UBERMAN                 What's the matter, miss your old                 jail cell?              Uberman starts walking toward the monitor.                                  MASTER MIND (ON MONITOR)                 Actually, I wanted to share the                 experience with my oldest friend.              A MECHANIZED CAGE shoots out of the floor, suddenly trapping       Metro City's protector.              Totally unfazed, our hero stares on.                                                                   7.                                                 UBERMAN                 You can't possibly believe this                 will work.              Master Mind pulls out a SMALL BLACK BOX with a SINGLE RED       BUTTON on it.                                  MASTER MIND (ON MONITOR)                 Oh, can't I? I have attained                 control of the Earth's most                 abundant energy source. I doubt                 even you are strong enough to                 withstand the FULL CONCENTRATED                 POWER OF THE SUN!!!              He presses the button.              EXT. OUTER SPACE              A sinister-looking SATELLITE orbits Earth's atmosphere. Its       bay doors suddenly open, deploying two huge SOLAR PANELS.              The panels shift, angling themselves in the direction of the       sun. They immediately start GLOWING as they absorb the       burning star's power.              The front of the satellite begins to make a loud HUMMING       SOUND as it prepares to unleash its unholy power.              INT. HYDROFOIL CONTROL ROOM - DAY              From the giant window we can see the boat is a good mile from       the observatory.                                  PLATO                 We're now at minimum safe distance,                 master.              Master Mind turns from the CAMERA he was broadcasting on and       puts down the control box.                                  MASTER MIND                 Excellent. Stop here, I like this                 view.                                  PLATO                 Twenty seconds until impact.              Master Mind turns to Roxanne who is being held by Da Vinci       and Einstein. She almost appears a little bored.              Disappointed by her lack of horror, he walks over to the       monitor now showing Uberman trapped in the cage.                                                                8.

UBERMAN (ON MONITOR)                 Yes: there's no caging the power of                 justice.                                  PLATO                 Ten seconds to impact.              On the screen we see Uberman take two of the cage's bars in       his hands. He yanks...NOTHING.                                   PLATO (CONT'D)                 Nine...

Uberman yanks on the bars again, this time using his foot as       leverage.                                  MASTER MIND                     (genuinely concerned)                 What's going on?                                  UBERMAN                     (straining)                 Hold...on...a second.              Master Mind looks back at Plato and Einstein. They're equally       befuddled at the hero's sudden weakness.                                   PLATO                 Seven...

Master Mind and the minions all cringe in unison.              Da Vinci turns to Roxanne not believing his ears.                                  DA VINCI                 What did he just say?                                                                9.

Uberman looks up at the camera with a very grave expression.                                  UBERMAN                 Like you don't know. These bars are                 made of copper, aren't they?                                     PLATO                 Four...

Then, as suddenly as it began, the awesome light dies out.              One by one, the passengers unshield their eyes and look out       toward the observatory.                                                                 10.

PLATO                 I don't think even he could have                 survived that.              Einstein suddenly turns giddy with excitement.                                  EINSTEIN                 Whoa! Is it me or did you just                 finally destroy Uberman?                                   MASTER MIND                     (carefully skeptical)                 Well...let's not get ahead of                 ourselves.              Da Vinci suddenly sees something outside.                                  DA VINCI                 Look, there's something in the sky,                 coming this way.                                   ROXANNE                 Uberman!              Master Mind turns toward the window.              An object is in the air, flying directly toward them. As it       closes in we can just make out the FAMILIAR OUTLINE OF A       CAPPED FIGURE.                                  MASTER MIND                 I KNEW IT! PREPARE YOURSELVES! HE'S                 GONNA RAM US!!!              Everyone scatters and braces themselves for the impact.              Master Mind, seeing all the good places taken, doesn't know       what to do with himself. He just covers his giant head with       his hands.              The figure CRASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW and lands at his feet.              He looks down to see a CHARRED BLACK HUMAN SKELETON. Around       its neck is the unmistakable black cape of Uberman.                                   MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                     (horrified)                 HOLY SHIT!                                                               11.                            Roxanne breaks out of Da Vinci's hold and runs over to the       body.                                   ROXANNE                 Uberman?              She stares down at the still smoking corpse, the tattered       black cape with the yellow ""U"" on it.              Roxanne turns to Master Mind, who's still visibly dumbfounded       at the grotesque sight before him.                                  ROXANNE (CONT'D)                 You killed him!              Roxanne's eyes roll back. Da Vinci catches her from behind as       she FAINTS.              Einstein turns to Master Mind, looking at him as if he's just       walked on water.                                  EINSTEIN                 You did it!              Now that he's committed the impossible - our villain is at a       complete loss.                                  MASTER MIND                 ...so I did.                                  EINSTEIN                 I mean, I know you always wanted                 to. I mean, all the schemes all the                 plots - I never thought you'd                 actually be capable of it.              Giddy as a school girl, Einstein turns to his fellow       henchmen.                                  EINSTEIN                 This is history. Every villain and                 lackey in the history of villains                 and lackeys dream of this moment,                 but when does it actually EVER                 happen?              A sudden realization comes over his face.                                  EINSTEIN                 Good lord...You do all realize what                 we get to do now, don't you?                                                                  12.                            His question is met with acquisitive looks from Master Mind       and the others.                                  EINSTEIN                 We get to go on a crime wave.

We PULL BACK to see the truck being carried by a giant claw       at the bottom of a BRAIN COPTER.              Inside the cockpit Master Mind and his henchmen laugh       maniacally.

Two beat officers see them and take chase after them around       the corner and into an alley.              After a moment the police reemerge from the alley screaming       and running for their lives as a GIANT ROBOT CHASES after       them.              The robot stops, then suddenly it's head opens up like       convertible car top with Master Mind and Plato at the       driver's wheel.

A VICIOUS TORNADO              It's heading for downtown Metro as Master Mind and the       lackeys coolly look on.              Three large DUMP TRUCKS pull up, filled to the brim with       bricks of CASH.                                                               13.                            The DRIVERS jump out as the lackeys take the driver seats in       the three trucks.              Master Mind is about to climb into the passenger seat of one       when a drivers taps him on the shoulder and motions toward       the tornado.                                   MASTER MIND                     (absentmindedly)                 Oh, right.              Master Mind pulls a television REMOTE from his pocket and       aims it at approaching windstorm of death.              He presses the button marked ""Tornado Off.""              The tornado shrinks and disappears just before it hits the       city.              As they drive through the city streets, Master stares out the       window with a hint of something in his eyes.

On top of the neon       lit building is a GIANT 30 FOOT TALL CEMENT BOWLING BALL.              INT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY              HAL STEWART (early 30's) takes careful aim with his BOWLING       BALL.                                  HAL                 It's a sport of honor, focus and                 grace. Honor the ball, focus on the                 pins, release the ball not hard and                 fast, but as if you were releasing                 a baby dove.              He takes a step, pulls back his arm, and releases the ball,       following it with his eyes.              It's a horrible shot - INSTANT GUTTER BALL.              An aged barmaid type with a cigarette hanging from her mouth       looks over at him.                                  HAL                 Okay, do something like that - but                 center it more.                                                                 14.                            She picks up her custom made FOGHAT BALL and takes aim.                                  ATTRACTIVE BLOND                 Tell me how my form looks, honey.              Hal focuses on the misshapen bumps of her enormous Johnson       administration era derriere.                                   HAL                 Oh, it's lookin' good. It's lookin'                 REAL good.              It doesn't get anymore clear. This man is a pig.                                  VINNIE (O.S.)                 Hal, I want to see you in my                 office!              Hal turns to see VINNIE, owner of the bowling alley, calling       him.                                  VINNIE                 Now!              INT. KINGPIN BOWLING - VINNIE'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER              Hal sits down, facing Vinnie who's sitting at his desk.                                  VINNIE                 You're fired. Leave your shirt and                 locker key.              This bit of news hits Hal like a freight train.                                  HAL                 Fired? Are you going to tell me                 why?                                  VINNIE                 Showing up to work late. Showing up                 to work late drunk. Sexually                 harassing customers. Stealing from                 the register.                                  HAL                 Vinnie, I don't know where you're                 getting these accusations -              Vinnie takes out a video tape from his desk drawer and puts       in a VCR.                                                               15.                                                    HAL                    Oh, which one do you supposedly                    have here?                                     VINNIE                    This is all of them at once.              TELEVISION              A WOMAN walks up to a BOWLING EMPLOYEE and hands him a pair       of shoes.              As the employee turns to the wall of shoes, a very drunk and       disheveled Hal comes running in and pushes him aside.                                     HAL                    I've got this one, Benny. So,                    Cinderella. Can I help you find                    your glass slipper?                                     WOMAN                    Yeah, I'm looking for a seven.              He folds his arms on the counter and leans into her with a       cat-like grin on his face.                                     HAL                        (with a leer)                    Seven - Well, maybe I could                    interest you in something in an                    EIGHT. Namely, me.              Disgusted, she walks off screen.                                     HAL                    Lesbo.              Suddenly realizing the register's open, he quickly grabs a       stack of cash and shoves it in his pocket.              BACK TO OFFICE              Vinnie turns off the television and waits for Hal to respond.                                     HAL                    From the angle of the camera, I can                    see where you might have gotten the                    wrong idea. Listen, Vinnie, I don't                    think you've thought this through.                    If you fire me, who's gonna be                    captain of the alley's bowling                    team?                                                                 16.                                                VINNIE                 Um, I don't know. Maybe somebody                 who can actually bowl. You guys                 have never won a game. I hired you                 because you said you were on the                 pro circuit.                                  HAL                 No, I said I WILL BE on the pro                 circuit.                                  VINNIE                 Please, a loser like you will never                 amount to anything.              This harsh remark seems to leave Hal genuinely stunned.                                  HAL                 Wow...If that's how you feel...I                 guess we should then talk about                 what kind of severance I'm gonna                 get.              EXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY              TWO BRUISERS open the door and throw Hal out onto the street.

CHANNEL 7 NEWS BUILDING - OFFICE - DAY              The cubicles and offices are alive with the hustle and bustle       of a busy news day.              Phones are RINGING, REPORTERS are TALKING, and Editors are       SHOUTING.              The elevator doors open and out steps Roxanne Ritchi.                                                               17.                            Everything stops as the entire office suddenly falls SILENT.              Somewhat taken aback by the reaction, Roxanne scans the room       to see every eye on her.                                  ROXANNE                 It's...um...It's good to be back.                 Thanks for everyone's cards and                 concerns. I really appreciated it -                 now I'm ready to climb back on the                 horse.              No one is budging - their looks of pity are really starting       to make her uncomfortable.              The back office door suddenly opens and out comes FRANK       BONIN, the gruff, middle-aged Producer of Channel 7 News.              Noticing the silence, he looks up and sees the sad       expressions on everybody's face.                                  FRANK                 Someone die or something?

FRANK                     (cursing himself)                 Oh, Jesus.                                     ROXANNE                 It's okay.              Frank quickly walks up to Roxanne and takes her gently by the       arm.                                  FRANK                 Come on into my office, sweetie.              INT.

ROXANNE                 What're you doing?                                  FRANK                 Keeping you warm before you go into                 shock.                     (toward the open door)                 DO I HAVE SLICE OPEN A CAMEL HUMP                 TO GET A GLASS OF WATER AROUND                 HERE?              A SECRETARY quickly enters with a bottled water. She sets it       on the table in front of them and leaves.              Roxanne pulls herself out of Frank's grasp and stands up to       face him.                                  ROXANNE                 It was a traumatic experience. Yes,                 everyone knows Uberman and me                 were...close. But what I really                 need - what would really make me                 better is getting back to work.              There's a sudden awkward silence from Frank.                                  FRANK                 Well, that's going to be...                                  ROXANNE                 I thought you'd be happy to have me                 back.                                             19.                                      FRANK       Oh, we are. Honey, nothing makes us       happier than to have our girl back,       but...                         ROXANNE       Yes?                        FRANK       Things have sorta...changed.                        ROXANNE       In three weeks?                        FRANK       Listen, I'm not one who likes to       open up wounds - especially ones       that are just starting to scab, but       you were sorta our go to girl for       the exclusive on Uberman. And now       that he's gone...I moved Brad into       your anchor spot.                        ROXANNE           (disgusted)       Brad? Brad Helms? The man is an       idiot.                        FRANK       It's the suits. They think it's       time to switch things up.                        ROXANNE       Oh, because they can't use me to       get the big story.                        FRANK       C'mon, Roxie. Using is in the       nature of what we do. They used       you, you used Uberman. Everybody's       happy.                        ROXANNE           (defensive)       I didn't use him.                        FRANK       Oh, I didn't mean that. I know you       two were in love or something. My       bad.                         ROXANNE       We were.                                                                  20.                                                FRANK                 And that's great.                                  ROXANNE                 Very in love.              There's a hind of self-doubt in Roxanne's expression, as if       she's failed to convince even herself of this.                                  ROXANNE                 Okay. So, where are they going to                 move me if Brad has my spot?                                  FRANK                 ...Human interest.                                  ROXANNE                 Bake sales and pet stories.                                  FRANK                 I told them I wouldn't be surprised                 if you just upped and quit. You                 busted your ass for that desk.              Roxanne can hardly get it out - she's busy swallowing her       pride                                  ROXANNE                 I'll take it.              Frank looks up at her, not believing what he's hearing.                                  FRANK                 What?              EXT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT              Amongst the jungle of high rises, one small building stands       out from the rest - A tiny, forgotten piece of 19th century       Gothic architecture.              LIGHTENING FLASHES, revealing TWO CONCRETE GARGOYLES holding       a cracked plaque, reading: METRO CITY LIBRARY.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT              A mixture of old and new. Dusty Victorian furniture and       dilapidated bookshelves sit side by side with pristinely       futuristic machinery.              The building has been converted into Master Mind's new SECRET       LAIR.                                                               21.                            In the center of the main room is a three storey tall GLOWING       BLUE ORB. At the base of it is a sign that reads ""Reactor -       Don't Touch.""              We PAN OVER to the READING ROOM where Master Mind is sitting       on a couch watching TELEVISION.                                  REPORTER ON TELEVISION (O.S.)                 It's been nearly six weeks, and                 still no word on the whereabouts of                 billionaire playboy, and                 philanthropist, Wayne Scott. Tune                 in at 11:00 as we look into what                 has become Metro City's biggest                 mystery.                                  TELEVISION NARRATOR (O.S.)                 We now return to ""The Hero of our                 Hearts: The Uberman story.""              Einstein and Plato come into the room holding a BAG OF LOOT.                                  EINSTEIN                 Just robbed the diamond exchange.                                  MASTER MIND                     (feigning pleasure)                 Great, great. Put it on the pile.              Einstein tosses it on a LARGE PILE of purloined valuables in       the corner of the room.                                  EINSTEIN                 Anything else today?                                  MASTER MIND                 No.              Master Mind turns his attention back to the screen. Plato       sees that Master Mind is in a funk and tries to snap him out       of it.                                  PLATO                     (cheerfully)                 Sir, the new reactor is installed.              Plato nods to the giant orb.                                  PLATO                 Do you want to throw the switch? I                 know how you love to start                 reactors.                                                                  22.                                                MASTER MIND                 Maybe later.              Einstein gives Master Mind a funny look then exchanges       glances with Plato before leaving the two of them alone.              Without turning away from the TV, Master Mind addresses       Plato.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 What is it, Plato?                                  PLATO                     (nervously)                 Sir, I can't help but notice that                 you've been...a little down lately.                                  MASTER MIND                 When I want your opinion I'll beat                 it out of you.                                  PLATO                 Yes, sir, I know, but please                 forgive my impertinence. It's just                 that you seem to have lost your                 lust for our profession. You've                 stopped going on jobs and spend                 most of your time watching Uberman                 specials.              Master Mind relaxes slightly and turns to face the window in       a classically contemplative pose. After an overdramatic       beat...                                  MASTER MIND                 I have defeated my greatest enemy.                 I have free reign over Metro City.                 I have more wealth than a thousand                 Sultans. I've achieved all I have                 worked for...so why am I so                 unhappy?              He walks over to a PAINTED PORTRAIT that looks almost exactly       like him, except slightly older, maybe meaner - MASTER MIND'S       FATHER.                                  MASTER MIND                 I mean, my father, god rest his                 evil and tormented soul, raised me                 straight from the test tube to be a                 symbol of evil.                           (MORE)                                                               23.                           MASTER MIND(cont'd)                 And, I have accomplished something                 he had only dreamed about - the                 destruction of Metro City's                 champion. I tell you, I've always                 lived with this unquenchable                 thirst. I thought it was to make                 him proud or to get absolute power.                 But now that I've pretty much                 accomplished both, I am at a loss.                                  PLATO                 ...I sort of have a theory about                 all that.                                  MASTER MIND                     (snippy)                 Oh, really?                                  PLATO                 Well, for one thing, maybe Uberman                 was more important to you than you                 thought.                                  MASTER MIND                 He was a worthy rival. Sometimes I                 wonder, did he consider me his evil                 equal or was I just an annoying,                 little gnat to him? ...What's the                 second part?                                  PLATO                 I think you sort of have a thing                 for Roxanne Ritchi.              Master Mind quickly takes his lackey by the throat.                                  MASTER MIND                 YOU WORM! HOW DARE YOU! WHERE WOULD                 YOU GET SUCH A NOTION?                                  PLATO                 Sir, your plans always involve Ms.                 Ritchi either being kidnapped or                 placed in danger. If that's not                 love, I don't know what is. It's                 the grown up equivalent of dipping                 her pigtails in the ink well. Don't                 you see? She's the one treasure                 that's always escaped you.              From Master Mind's expression, we see Plato's words beginning       to ring true.                                                                  24.                            INT. RESTURAUNT - DAY              Roxanne is having lunch with several girlfriends sitting       around her, gabbing.                                  FRIEND #1                 I can't believe you came back so                 soon.                                  FRIEND #2                 Are you sure it's not TOO SOON,                 honey?                                  ROXANNE                 I just wanted to get back to work.                                  FRIEND #3                 What we need to do is get you back                 on the saddle...the love saddle.              Friend 1 and 2 give 3 disapproving looks.                                  FRIEND #3                 It's been three weeks.                                  FRIEND #2                 She just lost the love of her life,                 Grace.              A WAITER comes by with a tray of CAESAR SALADS and begins       setting them out for the ladies.                                  ROXANNE                 I keep trying to tell people it                 wasn't really like that. Uberman                 and I - We were kinda having                 problems. We broke up.              The waiter ALMOST DROPS HIS TRAY AT THIS. The women are too       shocked by Roxanne's revelation to notice.                                  FRIEND #1                 You broke up with Uberman!                                  FRIEND #3                 You must have REALLY, REALLY high                 standards. I mean, you were dating                 a god. I mean, what's it take?                                  ROXANNE                 Maybe someone who's a little more                 aware of his faults. Someone a                 little more sensitive.                                                                  25.                                                FRIEND #3                 Right. Someone who listens, sexy                 but attainable with cute little                 cheeks like a hamster and                 heartbreak in his eyes.              She turns to Friend one and two to explain.                                  FRIEND #3                 She wants John Cusack.                                     FRIEND #2                 The actor?                                  FRIEND #3                 No, the famous pediatrist - Yes,                 the actor. Ever since we were                 teenagers, Roxanne's totally had                 the hots for him.                                  ROXANNE                 Well, until he miraculously comes                 walking into my life, I'm just                 going to take a little reflection                 time for myself.              The waiter gets a confused look on his face then slips away       as Roxanne and her friends continue to chat away.              EXT. RESTURAUNT - DAY              The waiter tosses his apron in a trash can, then rolls up his       sleeve and presses A STRANGE LOOKING DEVICE STRAPPED TO HIS       WRIST.              His image gets staticy, like a TV station going out, then       disappears - revealing the man's true form underneath: MASTER       MIND!                                  MASTER MIND                 Who the hell is John Cusack?              EXT. CITY STREET - DAY              A YOUNG MOTHER pushes her baby stroller past a building       construction site.              ACROSS THE STREET              A local POLITICIAN addresses a group of REPORTERS on the       sidewalk, including Roxanne.                                                                  26.                                                POLITICIAN                 The Fifth Avenue Renovation                 Project, which I championed, will                 breath new life into the downtown                 area. New life means new jobs and                 new revenue.                                  ROXANNE                 Councilman, is it true that your                 brother-in-law's construction                 company won the contract for this                 project?                                  POLITICIAN                 Well...er...yes, but...look I'm not                 here to answer a lot of crazy                 questions...              YOUNG MOTHER              The young mother stops halfway down the block, reaches into       the stroller and tries to comfort her now crying baby.              Above her, a CRANE is maneuvering a pile of STEEL GIRDERS to       an upper floor.              Hal comes around the corner and heads in her direction.              CRANE              The crane GRINDS TO A HALT. The OPERATOR has a confused look       on his face as he moves levers back and forth in an effort to       fix the problem.              Hal stops a few feet from the woman and stoops down to tie       his shoe.              CRANE              The operator's hand slips off the lever, hitting a RED       BUTTON. To his horror the crane DROPS ITS LOAD OF STEEL.              HAL AND THE WOMAN              The woman looks up to see the girders seconds from crushing       her and her baby. She screams.              Hal looks up and sees it as well. He starts to run out of the       way and crashes into the woman and stroller.              ACROSS THE STREET                                                                  27.                            The reporters turns their cameras just in time to catch on       film what appears to be Hal pushing the woman to safety just       as the GIRDERS CRASH TO THE GROUND.              HAL AND MOTHER              Tears of joy in her eyes, the woman picks up her baby and       kisses it.              Hal struggles to catch his breath as the mother turns to him.                                  YOUNG MOTHER                 Thank you! Thank you for saving me                 and my baby!              She hugs him with her free arm, weeping with joy.                                     HAL                        (not knowing what she's                         talking about)                 Huh?              He's a little uncomfortable with the woman's public display       of affection and the small child in-between their embrace.                                  HAL (CONT'D)                 There, there.              Hal slowly eases out of the woman's grip.                                  HAL (CONT'D)                 Okay, we better...well, I hear                 these little guys smother easy.              The reporters rush over and surround Hal and the mother.                                  ROXANNE                 What's it feel like to be a hero?              Hal looks up at Roxanne. Instantly, he's captivated by her       beauty.                                  HAL                 Well...I'm just a man doing what                 men do. You're Roxanne Ritchi,                 aren't you?              They're suddenly interrupted when another reporter pushes his       way in between them.                                  REPORTER                 Were you scared?                                                               28.                                                   HAL                    Scared? Who had time?              The reporters eat this up.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY    - NIGHT              TELEVISION              John Cusack stands in the rain looking up at a window of a       two story house. He holds up a BOOMBOX and ""In Your Eyes"" by       Peter Gabriel begins to play.              From the couch, Master Mind and his minions watch.                                     MASTER MIND                    John Cusack, huh? So all I have to                    do is have a cute puppy dog stare,                    be willing to make a fool of myself                    and - Oh, REMOVE BOTH MY BALLS.              He turns to see Da Vinci watching the movie and wiping a tear       from his cheek.                                     MASTER MIND                    Please, get a hold of yourself.              INT. BOOKSTORE - NIGHT              Roxanne is carrying a large paper coffee cup in her hands as       she peruses the isles. She sets it down on a shelf to pull a       book out and ends up KNOCKING THE DRINK OVER.                                     ROXANNE                    Shit.              She goes to pick it up when someone bends down and picks it       up for her.              Looking up to thank him, Roxanne is suddenly stunned       speechless - It's popular and critically acclaimed actor JOHN       CUSACK, or rather Master Mind disguised as him.                                     ""JOHN CUSACK""                    Oh the humanity - it was a Venti.                                     ROXANNE                        (stunned)                    You're...you're.                                     ""JOHN CUSACK""                    Yes, it's me. John Cusack...the                    actor.                                                                29.                            He notices the book she's reading.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 Hey, is that Shelly? Wait, I think                 remember something from that one -                 Let's see: ""My head is screaming `I                 want you and need you' - my heart                 it keeps reaching to see you and                 feel you - yet in the end, I'm                 alone once again."" Wow, I scare                 even myself. I'm sorry. I'm just                 really into poetry. Probably                 because I'm so sensitive and always                 going to great lengths to express                 myself. But enough about me. Can I                 fill you up?                                  ROXANNE                     (captivated)                 ...Yes.                     (catching herself)                 I mean, excuse me?                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 Can I fill you up? Your coffee.                                  ROXANNE                 Right.              INT. BOOKSTORE CAFE' - LATER              Roxanne talks as John Cusack listens to her every word       intently.                                  ROXANNE                 I did have a boyfriend - until                 fairly recently.              She suddenly begins to feel the stares around her as passers-       by being to notice who she's with.                                  ROXANNE                 I'm sorry - this is so surreal!                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 Yeah, they charge way too much at                 these places - Now back to your                 boyfriend. I'm interested and                 compassionate. I want to know about                 you.                                                               30.                                                ROXANNE                 Things were complicated. He was a                 man married to his work. There                 was...there was a lot of                 competition in his line of                 business. I'm sure you know what                 that's like.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 Sure. In my business, one thing I                 have is RIVALS. For example, mine                 is...uh...Lou Ferr...igno.                                  ROXANNE                 ...The body-builder who used to                 play The Hulk on TV?                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 Did he? Well, we're always up for                 the same roles. Did your boyfriend                 have someone like that? A                 particular rival that was always                 getting his goat - so to speak?                                  ROXANNE                 Well...one rival in particular                 seemed to get more of his attention                 than I ever did. But enough about                 my problems.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 NO, TELL ME MORE!!!              Suddenly realizing his outburst, he begins COUGHING to mask       it.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK"" (CONT'D)                 I'm sorry. I got a whooping cough.                 Had it ever since Serendipity. I                 WONDER WHERE OUR REFILLS ARE!!!                 (fakes cough) See, there it goes                 again. Please, go on.                                  ROXANNE                 Right, well, he seemed to need him                 more than he needed me.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 How do you mean?                                                                31.                                                ROXANNE                 It was conflict he thrived on. He                 always said he wouldn't know what                 to do with himself if Master - I                 mean, this guy were gone. It was                 like he needed it, like oxygen.              The answer to his mental funk hits him like a bolt of       lightening. He turns away from her as if for private time.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                     (almost to himself)                 I think I finally understand...The                 only logical answer is to recreate                 that rivalry - or if that's                 impossible, create one of equal                 structure. That's it!                                  ROXANNE                 What?              John Cusack snaps out of his dream-like haze realizing she's       heard every word.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 Oh, sorry, sorry. Just rehearsing                 for a part...where I play a man who                 talks to himself at inappropriate                 times.              In a sudden rush, he rises out of his chair.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 I have to go right now, but I'd                 really like to see you again - if                 that's alright.              Roxanne looks up at him - She can't help but laugh at the       craziness of the situation.                                  ROXANNE                 I'd love that.              INT.

MASTER MIND                 It's plain and simple.                 Extraordinary minds need                 extraordinary stimulation. Without                 that stimulus they wither and die.                 Therefore, there is only one                 logical conclusion: I must create a                 new superhero.                                  EINSTEIN                 Yeah, maybe that's not such hot                 idea...

Dressed in a lab coat, Master Mind enters through a SLIDING       GLASS DOOR rubbing his hands excitedly.                                  MASTER MIND                 Prepare the subject.              He glances down into a large HOLE in the floor to see a naked       thirty year old man, SEVERS, shivering. Above the hole, a       huge vat dangles precariously.              Master Mind steps behind a glass partition next to Plato and       Einstein.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Plato, pour the toxic waste.              Plato throws a switch causing the vat to tip hundreds of       gallons of green and brown goo into the hole.

Just a little sticky,                 but aside from that everything's                 completely -              BOOM - Severs explodes. A hail of blood and tissue covers       Master Mind and his men. For a good ten seconds nobody moves       an inch. Finally...

MASTER MIND                 Ah. Does he have extraordinary                 strength?                                     PLATO                 Well...no.                                  MASTER MIND                 Can he fly?                                     PLATO                 No.                                  MASTER MIND                 Resilient to weapons fire?                                     PLATO                 No.                                  MASTER MIND                 He just breathes under water, then.                                     PLATO                 Ah...yeah.                                                                34.                            Master Mind rolls his eyes and walks away.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - LABORATORY - DAY              The next guinea-pig, STENWICK, is standing in a sealed glass       tube not much wider than himself.                                  MASTER MIND                 Plato, the radioactive spider,                 please.              Plato throws the switch DROPPING A SINGLE SPIDER onto       Stenwick's arm.              Stenwick looks and winces as it bites him.                                  STENWICK                 Ow!              He brushes the spider off.                                  MASTER MIND                 Anything, Stenwick?                                  STENWICK                     (shaken)                 No. Ah...sir, I didn't know this                 was about spiders. I have a pretty                 severe case of arachnophobia.              Master Mind thinks for a moment, then turns to Plato.                                  MASTER MIND                 We're gonna need more venom.              Plato throws another switch, this time DUMPING THOUSANDS OF       SPIDERS on poor Stenwick. His SCREAMS begin to fade as he's       engulfed with swarms of crawling arachnids.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 How `bout now, Stenwick?                 ....Stenwick?              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - OFFICE - DAY              Master Mind is pacing back and forth. The muted TV plays in       the background.                                   MASTER MIND                 This has proven to be a challenge.                 I just don't know what I want. What                 do I want?                                                                 35.                            He stares at Einstein, Da Vinci and Plato, but they offer no       advice.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 I want a man of moral fiber with a                 strong sense of right and wrong.                 Someone who doesn't seek power -                 instead, they must have it thrust                 upon them and find, within                 themselves, the courage to rise to                 the occasion.              Einstein lets out a short laugh, getting everyone's       attention.                                  EINSTEIN                 Yeah, well, it sounds like what you                 want is Uberman.              Master Mind snaps the fingers of his non-metal hand.                                  MASTER MIND                 That's it! Why make a copy when the                 real thing will do?              The lackeys look at each other, they can't believe what       they're hearing.                                  EINSTEIN                 I was just kidding, sir. In case                 you forgot, you actually burned                 Uberman alive.                                  MASTER MIND                 Then we'll make a new one. Plato,                 bring me the box!              MINUTES LATER              Master Mind and the lackeys stand in a circle around a small       table.              Plato places a STAINLESS STEEL CHEST in the tables center.              As Master Mind opens it, he's immediately doused in WHITE       GLOW emanating from inside.                                  MASTER MIND                 Behold - Uberessence. The very                 thing that gave Uberman his                 superhuman powers.                                                               36.                                                EINSTEIN                 Where the hell did you get that?                                  MASTER MIND                 Oh, I shot him with a power sucking                 gun and had this idea to use this                 to clone a whole army of evil                 Ubermen. I'm not sure why I never                 got around to following up with                 that.                                  PLATO                 I believe he defeated you before                 you could, master.                                  MASTER MIND                 ...Right. Man, he was good!                                  DA VINCI                 You want another volunteer, sir?                                  MASTER MIND                 Not another volunteer driven by the                 need for personal gain. Somebody                 else, somebody pure.              Master Mind turns to see an INTERVIEW WITH HAL playing on the       muted television. Underneath his face is a blue caption with       white lettering that reads: ""Hal Stewart - Metro City's       Newest Hero?""                                  NEWS REPORTER                 ...who risked his own life to save                 that of a young mother and her                 child.                                  HAL                 Please, please, you're embarrassing                 me. I saw someone in need and I                 helped them. What more can we ask                 of ourselves. I ask you, what more?              A smile creeps across the evil one's face.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Somebody like him!              EXT. CITY STREET - DAY              Plato is sitting in the van, staring into a pair of       binoculars as he speaks on a cellphone.                                                               37.                                                PLATO                 Yeah, sir. This guy is a real piece                 of work. He used to teach bowling                 at Kingpin's.              INT. MASTER MIND'S HIDEOUT - DAY              Master Mind is sitting with his feet up on a computer console       as he speaks to Plato.                                  MASTER MIND                     (into phone)                 A modest profession to brilliantly                 hide his true heroic nature. I love                 it.              EXT. CITY STREET - DAY                                  PLATO                 Then you are absolutely going to                 love this -              We follow Plato's line of sight across the street where we       see HAL PLAYING WITH A LARGE GROUP OF BLIND CHILDREN.                                  PLATO                 - He volunteers at a school for the                 blind.              INT. MASTER MIND'S HIDEOUT - DAY              Intrigued, he suddenly sits up in his chair.                                  MASTER MIND                 He volunteers. He doesn't ask for                 any reward for his deeds. The fates                 are shining down on me. This Mr.                 Stewart is truly an unselfish soul.              EXT. BLIND SCHOOL - DAY              From a distance, Hal seems to be consoling an upset child       who's sitting on a rock. But up close...                                  HAL                 You greedy little bastard. I                 already gave you a twenty.                                  BLIND KID                 Hey, you want me to play along?                 Then pay up, bitch!                                                               38.                                                HAL                 Fine, but you better be convincing.              He gives the kid a bill out of his wallet and looks over his       shoulder to see a HOT TEACHER walking toward them.                                  HAL                 Here she comes, go to work.              Like a miniature Brando, the blind kid buries his face in his       hands and begins to cry.                                  BLIND KID                     (weeping)                 Why can't I see! Why God?              Hal puts a warm consoling hand on the weeping boy's shoulder.                                  HAL                 Hey, Peter. C'mon champ, let me                 look at you.              The Hot Teacher stops and curiously watches from a distance.              The boy looks up at Hal, tears running down his dark       sunglasses - he should get an Oscar.                                  HAL                 You know, in life we're all given                 no more than we can bear. This                 happened to you maybe because you                 were meant to rise above it - Maybe                 to be an inspiration to the other                 little Peteys out there.                                  BLIND KID                 You really think so, Hal?                                  HAL                 Hey, does it LOOK like I'm lying?                 Now c'mon, go feel your way to                 class before you get your little                 butt suspended.              The boy stands up and is about to take off.                                  HAL                 Petey, wait a minute.              Hal uses his shirt sleeve to wipe the tears away from the       boy's face before sending him on his way.                                                                39.                            The Hot Teacher grabs her chest. Her heart is about to       absolutely melt.                                  HAL                 Don't run into anything!              EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS              Plato lowers his binoculars. From his perspective, Hal should       be next in line for popehood.                                  PLATO                 I think I've seen enough, sir. This                 is your guy.                                  MASTER MIND (O.S.)                     (over radio)                 Then return to base. We have much                 work to do.              Plato starts up the van and pulls away.              INT. BAR - DAY              It's a busy night. A couple of trucker types are shooting       pool as the bartender slings drinks.              Hal is nursing a beer at the bar when he suddenly notices a       very ATTRACTIVE WOMAN sitting next to him.              As he goes to straighten his stool-posture, Hal suddenly       catches himself on the bar's TELEVISION - it's a story about       how he saved the woman and her baby at the construction site.              He turns back to the Attractive Woman next to him, then back       to the TV. A plan of attack is forming.                                  HAL                     (obviously playing it up                      for the woman's benefit)                 Oh, there it is again. This is                 really getting embarrassing now.              The woman looks up at the screen and gives Hal a double-take.                                  ATTRACTIVE   WOMAN                 Oh my God! It's you!   You're the man                 who saved that woman   and her baby                 the other day! It is   you, isn't it?              TRUCKER #1, getting a drink at the bar next to them,       OVERHEARS.                                                                40.                            Hal rolls his eyes and puts his hands up in the air.                                  HAL                     (to Attractive Woman)                 Oh, crap. You got me.              TRUCKER#1 taps Hal on the shoulder.                                  TRUCKER#1                 Let me tell you something. That was                 just about the bravest damn thing                 I've ever witnessed. (he turns to                 the rest of the bar) Hey,                 everybody! This guy's the hero from                 TV!              The bar ERUPTS IN CHEERS.              MOMENTS LATER              Hal is riding on the shoulders of TRUCKER#2 and TRUCKER#3 as       `I'm Holding Out For A Hero' plays on the jukebox.              TRUCKER#1 suddenly puts his hands in the air. The room       quickly goes silent.                                  TRUCKER#1                 I want to give you something.              He reaches into his pocket and takes out a medal. He holds it       up in the air for everyone to see.                                  TRUCKER#1 (CONT'D)                 Lost my whole platoon. They were a                 lot a good boys, a lot of good                 boys. That was just the way things                 were in ""The Grenada."" I'd rather a                 real hero have this.              Trucker#1 gives the medal to a speechless Hal.                                  ATTRACTIVE WOMAN                 Hey, you're on TV again.              The crowd looks up at the Television.              TELEVISION - CONTINUOUS              The anchor man, BRAD HELMS (early 40's, amazing mustache),       suddenly has a memo passed to him.                                                                  41.                                                BRAD HELMS                 This just in. Upon a second look at                 that tape from this morning, which                 we'll now replay for you, it                 appears it was not the heroic act                 it first seemed to be.              The tape shows Hal running in slow motion.                                  BRAD HELMS (O.S.) (CONT'D)                 With the tape slowed down you can                 actually see the man push the woman                 and her child out of the way in an                 effort to save his own life.              The tape shows Hal, in a clear act of self-preservation,       pushing the woman and child out of the way.                                                        CUT BACK TO:              INT. BAR - CONTINUOUS              In unison, everyone turns their heads back to Hal.                                  HAL                 I guess that looks kinda bad.              Trucker#1 snatches his medal back.              EXT. NEARBY ROOF - NIGHT              Master Mind, Da Vinci and Plato look down, spotting Hal       cutting through a dark alley.                                  DA VINCI                 There he is, boss.              Da Vinci hands Master Mind a fantastic looking silver rifle.                                  MASTER MIND                 Now, we're sure this won't kill                 him?                                  PLATO                 Yes, sir. He'll just feel a slight                 electrical shock.                                  MASTER MIND                 Good.              Master Mind raises the rifle and aims it at Hal.                                                                 42.                            EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT              Hal wipes the blood from his nose with his shirtsleeve.              A LIGHTENING BOLT suddenly zaps Hal in the back. His teeth       spark and arc electrons as his entire body shakes and       shudders violently. He finally collapses, knocking over a row       of garbage cans.              EXT. NEARBY ROOF - NIGHT              An angry Master Mind slaps Plato.                                  MASTER MIND                 Slight electrical shock?              EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT              Hal lies flat on his back, his jacket smoldering.              Dazed, he slowly rises to his feet and looks up at the sky.                                  HAL                 God, I hate the weather in this                 city.              Hal walks off into the night as he attempts to slap the       emitting smoke from his jacket.              EXT. NEARBY ROOF - NIGHT              Master Mind turns to Da Vinci.                                  MASTER MIND                 Follow him.              INT. HAL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT              It's a dirty, small studio. Laundry lies everywhere, dishes       are piled in the sink and the litter box looks like a       minefield.              Hal comes staggering in. Through his POV we see the lights       wobble and streak like a hallucination.              He shakes his head trying to clear thing up, but it looks       worse.              Hal makes his way to the kitchen table and plops down on a       chair. The room begins to swim.              His CAT jumps on the table and sits down in front of him.                                                                  43.                            From Hal's POV the cat's face looks like we're seeing it       through a kaleidoscope. Hal seems fascinated by it.                                   CAT                  You don't look so good, man.                                   HAL                  I don't feel good. I was struck by                  freaking lightening.              Suddenly Hal realizes his cat's talking to him.                                   HAL (CONT'D)                  AAAAAAHHHHH! You can talk?                                   CAT                  No, you're just hallucinating. By                  the way, we're out of orange juice.                                   HAL                  AAAAAAHHHHH!              Hal jumps up, trips over a cardboard box and knocks himself       out on the coffee table.              INT. HAL'S APARTMENT - MORNING              Hal lies in the same position we left him last night.              He sits up and grabs his head. He looks like he has the worst       hangover in the world.              Finally, he remembers last night. He looks around, but not       really sure what he's looking for.                                   HAL                  Man...              Shaking his head, he walks to the kitchen and opens the       refrigerator.              He pulls out an orange juice container and puts it to his       mouth. It's empty.              As if suddenly remembering something he looks from the carton       to the cat, who is busy cleaning himself.              He shakes the thought from his mind.              BATHROOM              Hal lifts the seat and unbuckles his pants.                                                               44.                            HAL'S FACE              He stares at the ceiling with half closed eyes. The       inevitable sound of urine hitting water starts. A content       look washes over his face.              There is a distinct sound of porcelain CRACKING and       SPLINTERING.              The sound intensifies. Hal looks down to see his URINE STREAM       SMASHING THE TOILET.                                      HAL (CONT'D)                    Oh, God!              He whips his stream away only to cut a LONG RIP IN THE WALL.                                      HAL (CONT'D)                    Oh, God!              He freaks out and begins to lose control of his flow as it       destroys everything he accidently aims at; the bathroom       mirror, a bottle of cheap cologne, the bathroom window.                                      HAL (CONT'D)                    Oh, God!              He aims back for the toilet, which is pretty much rubble now,       to see the floor give way.              Finally, the pee stops and he glances down the hole.              He sees his downstairs NEIGHBOR sitting at his breakfast       table. He has a fork halfway to his mouth as he stares at the       smashed toilet on his pancakes.              EXT. STREET - DAY              Hal turns the corner to see his bus pulling away from the       stop.                                      HAL                    Wait!              He starts running after it.              ZOOM - HE TAKES OFF LIKE LIGHTENING.                                     HAL (CONT'D)                    Whoa, whoa, whoa!              Unable to stop, he SLAMS INTO THE BACK OF THE BUS and falls       back to the ground.                                                                  45.                            As the bus continues on he sees an INDENTATION of his torso       right below the rear window.              Stunned, to say the least, he rises to his feet.                                  HAL (CONT'D)                 Something's not right here.              He slaps himself in the face as hard as he can.                                  HAL (CONT'D)                 Wake up! Wake up, Hal!              HONK!              Hal spins around to see a car barreling toward him.              He goes to jump out of the way - ZOOM - he FLIES TWO STORIES       UP, nails a building and comes crashing back down to the       sidewalk.              Hal sits up, disheveled and scared.                                  HAL (CONT'D)                 Okay, okay. Let's get it together,                 man.              He closes his eyes in an attempt to will back his sanity.                                  HAL (CONT'D)                 This is just some sort                 of...episode. It will pass, it will                 pass.              He opens his eyes and looks down the street. A BEAUTIFUL       NAKED WOMAN is coming toward him.                                  HAL (CONT'D)                 Well, not too fast I hope.              As she passes him and turns the corner out of his view he       catches ANOTHER NAKED WOMAN - an old disgusting one.                                  HAL (CONT'D)                 Yes, fast, fast!              He turns away from her in horror only to see AN ENTIRE BLOCK       OF NAKED PEOPLE going about their business.              He rubs his eyes and looks down the street again. Everyone       has returned to a clothed state.                                                               46.                            He relaxes a little until he looks down and notices that he's       floating a foot off the ground.                                  HAL (CONT'D)                 I think I need to go home.              INT. HAL'S APARTMENT - DAY              Hal's front door CREAKS as it slowly opens, revealing Master       Mind.              He walks over to the bathroom and smiles to himself as he       notices the giant hole in the floor.                                  MASTER MIND                 Welcome to your second birth, Hal                 Stewart.              Master Mind continues to survey the room. He stops to look       over a ""KARATE KID"" POSTER on Hal's living room wall.              He focuses on the majestic image of Pat Morita teaching a       young Ralph Macchio to kick.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Instruction is very important in                 the formative years. Every hero                 needs a mentor, a father figure to                 look up to.              He presses his special watch, causing his body to MORPH INTO       THE SPITTING-IMAGE OF PAT MORITA.                                   ""PAT MORITA""                 Perfect.              INT. HAL'S APARTMENT - DAY              Hal enters, grabs a bottle of vodka from atop of the fridge       and takes a long pull from it.                                  VOICE (O.S.)                 A man will usually find that if he                 drinks from a bottle, eventually,                 the bottle drinks from him.              Hal does a SPIT TAKE. In the corner a darkened figure stands.                                  HAL                 Who are you!?                                                                 47.                                                VOICE                 I am the guide on your journey.                 Fate has chosen you to be it's                 champion.              Pat Morita steps out from the shadows.              Hal passes out again.              LATER              We are close on Hal's face as his eyes flutter open. He       appears to be lying on the couch.              He hunches up on his elbows, looks around, but everything is       as it seems.              He lays his head back down.                                  HAL                 Thank God. It was a dream. Man, I                 must be losing it.              A voice sounds right next to his ear.                                  ""PAT MORITA"" (O.S.)                 You know you're out of orange                 juice?              Hal leaps up to find he's been resting his head on Pat's lap.                                  HAL                 Jesus! This isn't happening, this                 isn't happening.              Hal backs away and trips over a box.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 Calm. All things must be filtered                 through calmness.                                   HAL                 Bullshit! Sometimes it's best to                 freak out.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 I think we must work on your                 attitude first.                                  HAL                 Look I'm gonna call the cops in                 about two seconds if you don't get                 out of here.                                                               48.                            Pat rises and walks to Hal. He's so calm it makes Hal calm.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 Are you calm now?                                  HAL                 Yeah, I'm okay.              Pat slaps him across the face hard.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 Good, because we've got a lot of                 work to do.              Hal grabs his jaw.                                  HAL                 What the hell was that for?                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 Rule number one: expect the                 unexpected.                                   HAL                 Can you just tell me what this is                 all about?                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 The heavens are not in the habit of                 bestowing a gift such as this to                 just anyone. You are being rewarded                 for being a man of great moral                 fortitude with an unwavering belief                 in humanity.                                  HAL                 That's me alright.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 I am to train you so you may                 fulfill your destiny to defeat the                 great menace to Metro City: Master                 Mind.              Pat gets up and walks toward the door.                                   ""PAT MORITA"" (CONT'D)                 Come.                                  HAL                 We're are we going?                                                               49.                                                   ""PAT MORITA""                 To train.              EXT. PAT'S CAR - DAY              Pat is sitting in the driver's seat. The car is bumping up       and down.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 Strength is just as much in the                 mind as it is the muscle. Remember,                 both need to be exercised.              We PULL BACK to see Hal lifting the car up over his head.       He's hardly straining.                                  HAL                 I'M LIFTING A FREAKING CAR!!!              Pat leans on the HORN.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 Hey, Corky? You listening?              Two highly attractive female joggers run by. They're clearly       impressed with Hal's show of strength. He smiles and mouths a       ""hello.""                                  HAL                 Yeah, work both muscles.              EXT. DESERT - DAY              Pat cocks back the chamber of a .357 MAGNUM. He holds it up       and carefully takes aim...at Hal's chest.                                     ""PAT MORITA""                 Trust me.                                  HAL                 What are you doing!?                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 An invulnerability test. Something                 wrong?                                  HAL                 Uh...yeah. I would prefer not to                 get shot. Do not fire that thing!              Frustrated, Pat lowers the gun.                                                                50.                                                ""PAT MORITA""                 You're bulletproof.                                  HAL                 Okay, do you know that for sure?              Pat quickly aims and fires.              Hal lets out a high pitched scream as the bullet ricochets       off his chest.                                    ""PAT MORITA""                 I do now.              Hal looks down at his chest, not so much as a scratch.                                    HAL                 You suck.              EXT. SKY - DAY              Hal is in the air flying in a sitting position. He's weaving       back and forth.                                  HAL                 Ice Man, I got a bogie on my tail.                 Two Russian Migs coming in hard and                 fast.                                    ""PAT MORITA""                 Hey!                                    HAL                 What?              Hal looks down to see Pat Morita yelling at him from the roof       of a building down below.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 What did I tell you? Stomach down,                 hands up.              Hal sighs and assumes the proper superhero in-flight       position.                                  HAL                 God, I feel so gay.              Pat's CELL PHONE begins to RING. He answers it.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                     (in Master Mind voice)                 What is it?                                                               51.                                                ROXANNE (V.O.)                 John?              Pat panics. He looks up to make sure no one is in earshot.              He sees Hal now doing somersaults in the air.                                  HAL                 YEEEE HAWWWW!              Pat turns his attention back to the phone, talking in his       John Cusack voice.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                     (in Cusack voice)                 Yes, it's John Cusack.                                   ROXANNE (V.O.)                 Hi, it's Roxanne. Listen, I...I                 really enjoyed talking with you the                 other day.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 ...As did I.                                  ROXANNE (V.O.)                 Great. God, I feel really silly,                 and if you have a lot going on I                 totally understand. But, I was                 wondering if you maybe wanted to                 have lunch.              He can't believe what he's hearing.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                     (excited)                 I'd love to!              He quickly recovers his composure.                                  ""PAT MORITA"" (CONT'D)                 I mean, I AM a little hungry.                                  ROXANNE (V.O.)                 Great. How does the park sound,                 around noon-ish?                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 Sure!                                  ROXANNE (V.O.)                 Great, see you then.                                                               52.                            Pat hangs up the phone and returns it to his pocket as Hal       lands behind him.                                  HAL                 WHOOOOA! Man, that is so cool. It's                 like fly - Oh my God, I almost said                 it was like flying.                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 For the rest of the day I want you                 to continue to practice your flying                 posture.                                  HAL                 Why, where're ya going?                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 ...To do something...mysterious                 ...and Asian.                                  HAL                 Say no more, bro. I'll just keep at                 it, then.              EXT. PARK - DAY              John Cusack and Roxanne eat WRAPPED SANDWICHES while walking       through Metro City Park.                                  ROXANNE                 How's your sandwich?                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 It's quite delicious.                                  ROXANNE                 Hope you don't think I'm too                 forward. Some men are intimidated                 when a woman asks them out. I just                 find you really easy to talk to.                                     ""JOHN CUSACK""                 And I you.                                  ROXANNE                 You know, you're not at all like                 you are in the movies.                                     ""JOHN CUSACK""                 I'm not?                                                               53.                                                ROXANNE                 Yeah. I don't know - You have this                 strange, refined way of speaking.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 I do? That is most interesting.                                   ROXANNE                 Anyway, when we were talking the                 other day I just felt, even though                 we only talked for a couple of                 hours, that we've known each other                 for years.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 I know just what you mean.              Roxanne bites into her sandwich.                                  ROXANNE                 You know what? This sandwich is                 disgusting.              She tosses it in a nearby garbage can.                                   ROXANNE (CONT'D)                 Of course I already ate half of it.                 I wonder what that says about my                 character?                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 It means you don't give up on a                 sandwich. You see that it has                 potential, and you give it every                 chance to be all it can be.              Roxanne smiles at his analogy.                                  ROXANNE                 Thanks, but knowing me, I was                 probably projecting my expectations                 of what a lunch should be on the                 sandwich. It might have been okay                 at first, but I just made it                 bitter.              John Cusack notices Roxanne's smile starting to fade.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 Is that what happened with your                 last sandwich - I mean, boyfriend?                                                               54.                                                ROXANNE                 When I look back, I probably                 shouldn't of expected so much from                 him. He was already a giving                 person. You know, one of those go                 out and save the world types.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 I've run into a few.                                  ROXANNE                 I was selfish, I guess. I didn't                 want to share him with anybody                 else.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 It sounds like he was a special                 man.                                  ROXANNE                 They broke the mold.              John Cusack arches his eyebrow in a very familiar manner.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 Perhaps not.              INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY              Hal walks up to Pat Morita sporting a Lone Ranger-type mask       and wearing a purple and red superhero costume. It's not       unlike Uberman's except for a giant ""T"" on his chest. (From       here on, Hal is referred to as TITAN)                                  TITAN                 What's the ""T"" stand for?                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 Titan.                                  TITAN                 What's that supposed to mean?                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 It's from Roman mythology. Zeus's                 father...oh, just go with it. You                 look perfect.                                  TITAN                 I don't think this mask is big                 enough. Are you sure no one is                 gonna recognize me?                                                                55.                                                ""PAT MORITA""                 It's fine, just don't slouch. It's                 all in the posture.              He grabs Titan's shoulders like a proud papa.                                  ""PAT MORITA"" (CONT'D)                 It is time.              INT. BANK - DAY              There is a long line of people snaked around the velvet       ropes. They're all waiting for their chance at the one open       teller window.              Four men wearing BEATLES MASKS(JOHN,PAUL,GEORGE,AND RINGO)and       CARRYING SHOTGUNS enter the bank.              John fires a shot in the air, sending everyone into an       immediate panic.                                  JOHN                 Alright folks, this is a robbery.                 Nobody moves - yadda, yadda,                 yadda...              Ringo jumps over the teller wall and starts stuffing bills       into a bag.              As John and Paul cover the crowd, George goes to the corner       office and puts a gun to the BANK MANAGER'S head.                                  GEORGE                 The safe. Let's go.                                  BANK MANAGER                 Okay, just don't hurt anyone.                                  GEORGE                 Yeah, yeah, yeah.              George leads him out by the collar.              CRASH - Titan smashes through the window and lands in a bold       superhero stance with hands on hips.                                  TITAN                 Well, boys, there's no need for all                 this just to get the free toaster.              Paul cocks his gun.                                                                  56.                                                PAUL                 What are you suppose to be?              We move in for a nice dramatic close up.                                    TITAN                 Justice.                                  GEORGE                 Well, justice, suck on this...              George, John and Paul open fire on Titan.              He just stands there and yawns as the bullets bounce off him.              With their guns empty the three just stare at him in       amazement.                                  TITAN                 Now it's my turn.              He turns to George.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 Hey, George, here comes the sun.              Titan grabs George and throws him into a fluorescent light       fixture in the ceiling.              Paul tries to run for the door. Titan snatches the collar of       his jacket.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 Say, Paul, your mother should                 know...that you're a scumbag.              He tosses Paul out the window and into a parked DELIVERY       TRUCK.              Titan turns around just as John hits him with the butt of his       shotgun. It instantly breaks apart in his hands.              Titan lifts him like a rag doll up into the air.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 John, all you need is love...              He throws John who lands on top of a cubical wall - GROIN       FIRST.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 ...and a good urologist.                                                               57.                            Titan effortlessly hops over the teller wall to find Ringo       cowering on the floor.              He grabs him by the shirt and lifts him up.                                  HAL                 Well, Ringo...um...um...you're                 under arrest.              EXT. BANK - DAY              Titan walks out of the bank with Ringo and George under his       arm. He's suddenly swarmed by a group of television       reporters, including Roxanne.              Across the street is Pat Morita. He watches Titan's first       news conference with great anxiety.                                  BANK MANAGER                     (to Hal)                 On behalf of the First National                 Bank of Metro City, I'd like to                 offer you a reward for your act of                 bravery.              He hands Titan a check.                                  TITAN                     (reading)                 Ten thousand dollars!              Titan looks over to Pat, who violently shakes his head no.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                     (unenthusiastically)                 I...can't except this. Law and                 order is it's own...um...reward.              Pat gives him the thumbs up. Pat turns, suddenly seeing       Roxanne with her camera crew. Captivated, his eyes lock on       her.              Meanwhile, Roxanne and her cameraman, SETH, are maneuvering       around the crowd to get closer to Titan.                                  BRAD HELMS (O.S.)                 Not so fast, Roxanne.              They both turn to see Roxanne's reporter rival Brad Helms,       Geraldo without the class, and his cameraman, FRANK.                                  BRAD HELMS                 This story's mine.                                                                  58.                                                ROXANNE                 Listen, Brad. We were just in the                 area. I was just trying to -                                  BRAD HELMS                 I've been in this business long                 enough to know pretty well what you                 were ""just trying to do."" Besides,                 I heard you couldn't take the big                 game anymore and were put on fluff                 detail?              Dejected, Roxanne turns and motions for Seth to turn the       camera off.                                  SETH                 You're not gonna take that from                 him, are you?                                  ROXANNE                 He's right. Old habit, I guess.                     (to Brad)                 We'll get out of your way.              As they walk off, Brad makes a comment to Frank loud enough       for her to hear.                                  BRAD HELMS                 Besides, I'm sure there's a pancake                 supper somewhere that needs                 covering.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - OFFICE - DAY              ON TELEVISION              We see the news conference on the bank's steps. In the corner       of the screen is written: ""recorded earlier.""                                  BRAD HELMS                 For months now, since the death of                 Uberman, the citizens of Metro City                 have been holding out for a hero.                 Well, it appears they won't have to                 hold out for much longer as a new                 costumed crusader has suddenly                 stormed onto the scene. Today, at                 the Metro Savings and Trust, a                 masked mystery man single-handedly                 defeated ""The Fab Four Gang."" Just                 who is this new caped avenger?              Brad holds the microphone to Titan's face.                                                                59.                                                BRAD HELMS                 I'm sure all of our viewers are now                 wondering, what's the ""T"" stand                 for?                                  TITAN                 It's a message to all the scum out                 there. Uberman may be gone, but                 Metro City has a new protector, and                 his name is ""Tighten!""              Another reporter leans in.                                  REPORTER                 How do you spell that?              We PULL BACK to see Plato and Da Vinci watching this       spectacle. Master Mind is sitting with them, reading a       NEWSPAPER.                                  MASTER MIND                     (reading paper)                 Oh, for heaven's sake. I can't                 believe it. He misspelled his name.              Master Mind holds up the newspaper. The headline reads       ""Metro's New Hero: Tighten.""                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 No matter, I suppose.              Master Mind throws the paper on the floor and begins to pace       around the room with his arms folded behind his back.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 We've now fully established Titan                 as Metro City's hero. They will                 love him just as they loved                 Uberman. Everything is going                 according to plan.              Einstein leans over and whispers in Plato's ear.                                  EINSTEIN                     (whispering)                 Yeah, if the plan is getting us in                 jail.              Master Mind turns around, facing Einstein. He walks over,       standing face to face with the rebellious henchmen.                                                               60.                                                MASTER MIND                 You know, Einstein, maybe I should                 have called you Socrates. He also                 didn't know when to keep his                 thoughts to himself.                                   EINSTEIN                 I just fail to see the point in all                 of this. I mean, why are we                 creating another superhero when it                 was such a pain in the ass for you                 to get rid of the other one? I                 mean, Uberman is destroyed, we                 should be using this opportunity                 to...to...                                    MASTER MIND                 To what?                                  EINSTEIN                 I don't know. To take over the                 weather, space, the world -                 whatever super villains are                 SUPPOSED to do.                                  MASTER MIND                 The reason someone like you will                 always be a minion is because you                 have no foresight. We take over the                 earth, like you said. Then what?                 Women? Cars? Money? Even the                 grandest treasures will lose their                 lustre if you don't have someone to                 hold them over.              Einstein throws up his hands. He's had enough. He pulls off       his wig and throws it to the floor.                                  EINSTEIN                 That's it! This balance of the                 force bullshit is getting way too                 Oprah for me. I'm blowing. Who's                 with me?                                    MASTER MIND                 You dare?                                  EINSTEIN                 Yeah, I dare. I'm sick of wearing                 stupid costumes, and I'm sick of                 working for a super villain who's                 turning into a softie.                                                               61.                            Plato and Da Vinci's mouths drop to the floor. They turn to       Master Mind for his rebuttal.                                  MASTER MIND                 What - did - you - call me?                                  EINSTEIN                 You heard me. You used to be an                 inhuman monster, now look at you.                 You're creating super heroes, you                 don't go with us on robberies                 anymore, it's been days since you                 threatened anyone, oh, and not to                 mention this Roxanne Ritchi thing.                                  MASTER MIND                 THAT is none of your business,                 knave!                                  EINSTEIN                 Hey, you guys haven't sealed the                 deal yet, have you?                                   MASTER MIND                 Silence!                                  EINSTEIN                     (In a woman's voice)                 Oh, Master, your head is so big.                                  MASTER MIND                 I'm warning you, Einstein.                                  EINSTEIN                     (In a woman's voice)                 Take me!                                  MASTER MIND                 I said silence!              With his metal gauntlet Master Mind grabs Einstein by the       throat and lifts him into the air.              Einstein looks frightened as he tries to pry himself free of       Master Mind's grip.              Master Mind's eyes soften as if his heart is suddenly not       into what he's about to do. He let's Einstein drop to the       floor.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Get out of my sight.                                                                62.                            EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT              Roxanne and John Cusack are eating on the outside patio of a       fancy restaurant.                                  ROXANNE                 Don't get me wrong, I love being a                 reporter. I don't think I could do                 anything else. It's the                 consequences of what we do that I'm                 having a problem with.              He listens intently as he refills her glass with wine.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 That's where journalistic                 responsibility comes in, no?                                  ROXANNE                 It's supposed to.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 Sounds to me like you're running                 from something.                                  ROXANNE                 I got someone I cared about killed.                 If it wasn't for me, he wouldn't                 have been involved.              John suddenly gets a disturbed look in his eye, realizing       what she's talking about.              He reaches across the table and takes her hand.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 You can't blame yourself. My father                 used to say each of us must answer                 the great call to truly feel alive.                                  ROXANNE                 Was he an actor?                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 ...No. He was...a landscaper. And a                 horrible one. I mean he would fail                 time and time again at                 his...landscaping. And sometimes                 he'd get pretty beaten up or thrown                 in jail -                                  ROXANNE                 Jail?                                                               63.                                                ""JOHN CUSACK""                 My point is he took the good with                 the bad. He grew a little each                 time. Improved, learned.                                  ROXANNE                 Was he ever successful?                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 God, no...but don't let deter you.              Roxanne LAUGHS.                                  ROXANNE                 Thanks for this. You know, this is                 embarrassing, but it's been a long                 time since I -              It's starting to lightly sprinkle. Roxanne looks up.                                  ROXANNE (CONT'D)                 I think it's starting to rain. We                 might want to find a table inside.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 What were you gonna say?                                  ROXANNE                 Oh, I was gonna say...It's been a                 long time since...well, I've been                 with someone I...enjoy being with.              John Cusack smiles warmly and raises his glass for a toast.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 To people who enjoy being with each                 other.              They go to clang glasses, when the rain suddenly causes John       Cusack's disguise generator to short.              His true form of Master Mind is briefly revealed to Roxanne       as a BOLT OF ELECTRICITY encircles his body.              Roxanne drops her glass and jumps out of her seat.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Oh, no. Don't look at me.              LIKE A BROKEN TV the image keeps switching between MASTER       MIND AND JOHN CUSACK.                                                               64.                            As Master Mind starts to franticly slap at his watch, the       Cusack disguise begins to hold steady.              He nonchalantly returns to cutting his steak.                                  ""JOHN CUSACK""                 Okay, never mind that. Now, where                 were we?              Roxanne grabs his glass and throws the drink in his face,       causing the generator to short out permanently.              Master Mind now sits in his true blue form.                                     ROXANNE                 Oh my God.                                  MASTER MIND                 You're not gonna get all freaky                 about this, are you?                                  ROXANNE                 This...this is too much, even for                 you. God, I go out with you, tell                 you my innermost thoughts.                                  MASTER MIND                 I only did this because I wanted to                 talk to you on the same level. You                 know, without all the baggage?                                  ROXANNE                 Baggage? You burned my boyfriend                 alive, you sick son-of-a-bitch!                                  MASTER MIND                 You see, that's exactly what I'm                 talking about.              Roxanne starts to walk away.                                     MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Roxanne!                                  ROXANNE                 Stay away from me.              Master Mind sinks back down to his chair. Despite the now       heavy rain bombarding him, he returns to his food.              Several resturaunt patron's are looking at him through the       window.                                                                  65.                            Our villain turns to them, giving them a villainous glare.                                  MASTER MIND                 What?              INT. MASTER MIND'S BEDROOM - NIGHT              Master Mind is lying on his back, wide awake.                                  MASTER MIND                     (mumbling to himself)                 Stupid. What was I thinking? Plato,                 it's his fault. He's the one who                 sent me on this weak-willed path.                 I'll filet his scrotum for this.                 Me, a creature of evil, in love                 with Roxanne Ritchi. Preposterous.                 I hardly give such matters thought              He rolls onto his side. He yawns and closes his eyes.              Suddenly, they shoot back open.                                                       CUT TO:              EXT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT              Master Mind pulls up in a blue Rolls Royce, across the street       from Roxanne's apartment              He stares up at the building, hoping to catch a glimpse of       her.              Finally, she appears, primping her hair in her apartment       window's reflection.                                  MASTER MIND                 I should just go up there and just                 lay it all out to her. ""Roxanne, I                 like you - I always have. Oh, and                 I'm sorry I blew up your ex.                 (realizing the absurdity of his                 words) Yeah, that would go over                 like a pants-less clown at a                 child's birthday party. What the                 hell am I even doing here? Who                 cares what she thinks? I'm a                 supervillain and here I am acting                 like a love struck schoolboy.                 Forget this. I control my own                 destiny!                                                                 66.                            He turns the ignition key - NOTHING HAPPENS. He repeats but       gets the same results.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                     (disgusted)                 Perfect.              INT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT              She pulls a pack of smokes off her night stand. Empty.                                     ROXANNE                 Damn.              She grabs her long coat and throws it over her robe.              EXT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT BUILDING              Roxanne steps outside.                                  ROXANNE                 Please be open.              Across the street is a liquor store. The light is still on.                                     ROXANNE (CONT'D)                 Thank God.              She walks across the street, passing in front of Master       Mind's car.              Spotting her, he sinks down in his seat.              Roxanne walks by, totally unaware of his presence.              Relieved, Master Mind sits back up and watches her go into       the store.              INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT              Roxanne walks up to an elderly Korean SHOPKEEPER at the       counter.                                  ROXANNE                 A pack of Lady Strikes, please.              EXT. MASTER MIND'S CAR - NIGHT              Master Mind is talking on his cell phone.                                  MASTER MIND                 Hello, Triple A?                                                                  67.                            He suddenly spots something across the street.              EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT              A HOODLUM walks up to the entrance of the store and pulls out       a gun from under his coat.              EXT. MASTER MIND'S CAR - NIGHT              Master Mind stares in shock.                                  MASTER MIND                 I'll call you back.              He hangs up the phone and watches the Hoodlum go inside the       store.              INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT              The Hoodlum reaches across the counter and grabs a fist full       of cash from the register.                                  SHOPKEEPER                 Hey!                                  SHOTGUN HOODLUM                 Shut up, Gramps.              He turns to Roxanne, spotting a GOLD NECKLACE around her       neck.                                  SHOTGUN HOODLUM (CONT'D)                 Gimme that necklace!                                  ROXANNE                 I don't think so.              The Hoodlum cocks his shotgun.                                  SHOTGUN HOODLUM                 I said give it to me!                                  MASTER MIND (O.S.)                 The lady said no.              The hoodlum turns around to see Master Mind in the doorway       holding a STRANGE-LOOKING HAND CANNON (GOO GUN) with knobs       and blinking lights.              The hoodlum starts to laugh.                                                               68.                                                SHOTGUN HOODLUM                 What the hell's that? A super                 soaker?                                  MASTER MIND                 No, it's a goo gun.              The hoodlum turns his gun to Master Mind.                                  SHOTGUN HOODLUM                 Yeah, what's it do?                                   MASTER MIND                 It goos.              Master Mind fires the cannon. It instantly covers the store       in a cloud of SMOKE.              The smoke clears to reveal the hoodlum STUCK TO THE WALL,       covered in a thick, GREEN GUNK.              Roxanne stares at him, dumbfounded.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 It's...a prototype.              Master Mind starts to walk out when he's suddenly confronted       by the shopkeeper.                                  SHOPKEEPER                 I know you! You Master Brain guy.                 You a hero.              Master Mind points the goo gun at him.                                  MASTER MIND                 Don't - EVER - say that again.              EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT              Master Mind walks out with the cannon resting on his shoulder       like he's a short timer in Da Nang. Roxanne follows shortly       behind him.                                   ROXANNE                 Hey!              Master Mind turns around.                                  ROXANNE (CONT'D)                 Are you following me or something?                                                                69.                                                MASTER MIND                 Don't flatter yourself.              He turns away and continues walking. Roxanne runs in front of       him blocking his way.                                  ROXANNE                 Don't walk away from me when I'm                 talking to you.              Finally it occurs to her what's going on.                                  ROXANNE (CONT'D)                 What a minute...all that stuff you                 use to say to me when Uberman was                 alive - about me being the loyal                 queen by your side as you rule over                 Metro City. That wasn't just super                 villain rhetoric, was it? You                 actually meant it!                                  MASTER MIND                 My, someone has a rather high                 opinion of themselves.              They stare at each other in silence, their glares locked in       conflict.                                  ROXANNE                     (coldly)                 Do you really think I would be with                 someone like you?              This stings Master Mind to the bone. And after a brief       contemplation, he reaches the only logical, painful       conclusion.                                  MASTER MIND                 No.              With that, Master Mind exits into the night, leaving Roxanne       with a baffled expression on her face.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY    - NIGHT              Master Mind enters in a huff. Da Vinci closes the door behind       him as Plato notices his master's agitated state.                                  PLATO                 Everything alright, sir?              Master Mind GRABS PLATO BY THE GROIN with his metal gauntlet       causing Plato's eyes to bulge in pain.                                                               70.

Master Mind tightens his grip.                                    MASTER MIND                 Go on.                                  PLATO                 ...distracted.              Master Mind releases him.                                  MASTER MIND                 Just with business, my minion. Just                 with business. I've decided it is                 time.                                    PLATO                 You mean?                                  MASTER MIND                 Yes, we've created our hero, now                 it's time to give him a little                 motivation.                                  DA VINCI                 How do we do that?                                  MASTER MIND                 To be simply good is not enough. A                 hero must be driven by an almost                 relentless desire to right a wrong                 that can never be corrected.                                    PLATO                 You mean?                                  MASTER MIND                 Yes, he must lose someone near and                 dear to him - his father figure.

SKY OVER METRO CITY - DAY              Titan flies high over and through the city, under bridges,       between buildings, etc. He's not really working, just       enjoying himself.                                                                  71.                            INT. WOMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT              A PRETTY WOMAN sits at her makeup table wearing nothing but       her bra and panties. Through the reflection in her mirror we       see a large window directly behind her.              As she applies lipstick we see Titan fly quickly by in the       background. After a moment he slowly slides back in view and       begins ogling the girl.              She sees him in the mirror and quickly covers herself with a       robe.              Titan tries to hide his face as he zooms off.              MOMENTS LATER              Titan looks down to see an APARTMENT BUILDING IN RUIN.       Emergency lights flash around it as swarms of people run       around in chaos.                                  TITAN                 Man, what the hell happened down                 there? Wait a sec -              He stops in mid-air as he comes to the striking realization.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 THAT'S MY APARTMENT!!!              EXT. HAL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY              Titan lands in front of the rubble that was once his home.       Reporters stand just beyond the police line.                                    TITAN                 Crap.              From the wreckage crawls a dying Pat Morita.                                    TITAN (CONT'D)                 PAT!              Titan goes and kneels beside Pat, holding him in his arms.                                    TITAN (CONT'D)                 You okay?                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 I'm dying, kid. There is just one                 last lesson I have for you. It is                 the most important of all.                                                                 72.                                                TITAN                 What's that?                                   ""PAT MORITA""                 Master Mind did this, you must                 avenge me.                                  TITAN                 Master Mind? Why?                                  ""PAT MORITA""                 Because he's evil. You must stop                 the evil Hal - stop the...              Pat's body goes limp.              The cameras begin to pop and flash around them.              Titan gently lays Pat's body down and stands respectfully       over him. The reporters rush over.                                  REPORTER 1                 Tighten, Is this the work of Master                 Mind?                                  REPORTER 2                 How will the death of your mentor                 affect your resolve?                                  REPORTER 3                 Was that Pat Morita?              Titan walks up to one of the cameras.                                  TITAN                 This injustice will not go                 unpunished. Master Mind, if you can                 hear me, Tighten is coming for you.              In the background we see Plato and Da Vinci, DRESSED AS       PARAMEDICS, load pat's body onto a stretcher.              PLATO ACCIDENTALLY DROPS HIS SIDE. As he bends down to pick       it back up, Pat quickly slaps him, then goes back to playing       dead.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT              Master Mind and the boys prepare the fortress for Hal's       revenge attack. Master Mind is as giddy as a schoolboy.                                                               73.                                                MASTER MIND                 Alright, people, we don't have much                 time. Titan should be here any                 minute, so let's get the lead out.              There is a GIANT MOUNTED DEATH RAY in the middle of the hall       being tinkered with by Da Vinci.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 How's the death ray coming?                                  DA VINCI                 Nearly up to full power, sir.                                  MASTER MIND                 Hum. Let's turn it down a few                 notches. It's his first time and                 we don't want to get in a lucky                 shot, now do we?              Plato enters the room.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Anything on the radar yet?                                  PLATO                 Not yet, sir.                                  MASTER MIND                 I see. Well, he must be planning                 something big. Are the flame                 androids deployed?                                  PLATO                 All twelve.              Master Mind rubs his hands in anticipation as he sits down on       his throne.                                  MASTER MIND                 Wonderful, wonderful. Plato, Da                 Vinci, take your places next to me.              They move to either side of the chair.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 No slouching.              Da Vinci straightens up and sucks in his gut.              They remain this way for several long moments. Master Mind       occasionally glances at a DIGITAL CLOCK on the wall. Still no       Titan.                                                                74.                            LATER              Apparently quite some time has passed. The bold stances have       degraded to fatigue.                                  PLATO                 He's certainly taking his time.                                  MASTER MIND                 He'll be here. That's the way it                 works.              STILL LATER              Master Mind reclines in his chair and taps his metal gauntlet       impatiently on the armrest.              Plato has squatted down, resting his chin on his hand.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Unprofessional, that's what this                 is. No, it's disrespect for the                 craft.              Master Mind rises and begins to pace back and forth.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Would Uberman have kept us waiting                 like this? Of course not. He was a                 pro who knew the score. It's time                 we spelled out a few things for                 this Titan. I will not be made a                 fool of.              He storms out of the room.              INT. HAL'S NEW APARTMENT - DAY              Titan's sitting on the floor in a barren apartment wearing       his costume top and some tighty whities. He sips his beer as       he watches a basketball game on a tiny TV.              Much to his annoyance, there's a KNOCK at the door.                                  TITAN                 Oh, for crying out loud.              He gets up and opens the door. It's Master Mind.                                  MASTER MIND                 Do you know who I am?                                                                  75.                            It takes a few moments to register, but Titan's suddenly       excited.                                  TITAN                 Yeah, you're Master Mind. Yeah!                 You're actually the guy I want to                 see!                                  MASTER MIND                 Oh, so NOW you want to get down to                 it. Well, I want to get a few                 things off my chest first.              Master Mind walks past Titan into the apartment. He spins       around, pointing at him accusingly with one of his metal       fingers.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Of all the inconsiderate - Do you                 have any idea how long we waited                 for you? We're you even planning on                 coming to me and getting revenge?              Titan shuts the apartment door, and turns back toward his       guest.                                  TITAN                 Well, at first I was going to. You                 know, because that's what I figured                 I was supposed to do. But then I                 got to thinking-                                  MASTER MIND                     (interrupting)                 -You got to thinking? There's                 nothing to think about. I'm the                 villain. I do something bad, you                 come and get me.                                  TITAN                 - I got to thinking...what's the                 point?              Master Mind throws up his hands.                                  MASTER MIND                 Maybe you're right. What's the                 point?              He suddenly notices something in the corner of his eye. He       walks over to a futon in the living room. On top of it is a       LARGE SACK OVERFLOWING WITH GOLD WATCHES,RINGS AND OTHER       VALUABLES.                                                               76.                                                MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 What are these?                                  TITAN                 That's what I wanted to talk to you                 about.                                  MASTER MIND                     (baffled)                 Where did you get all this?                                  TITAN                     (proudly)                 Get this: I stole them.                                  MASTER MIND                 From where?                                  TITAN                 From all over. You see, once you                 killed Pat and ruined my other                 apartment building I was pretty                 pissed off, so I figured I'd go,                 find you and kick some ass. Then I                 thought to myself: ""Okay,then                 what?"" I mean, if we were to fight,                 what would I get out of it? Would I                 get my apartment back? Would I be                 able to pay the bills?                                  MASTER MIND                 Well, what about your mentor?                                  TITAN                 Tell you the truth? He was kind of                 a dick. I mean, being a hero is                 dandy and all, but it's volunteer                 work. Now you've always had the                 right take on all this. I mean,                 when you rob a bank or take over                 the diamond exchange you get                 something out of it. I mean, when                 you don't get caught, which, no                 offense, isn't very often. And that                 brings me to what I wanted to                 propose to you: Who could catch you                 if I'm by your side?              Perplexed by his proposal, Master Mind just stares at Titan       awe-struck.                                  MASTER MIND                 You want to team-up?                                                                  77.                                                TITAN                 You got the brains, I got the                 brawn. We could even call ourselves                 that: `Brain' and `Brawn'. Look at                 this.              Titan picks up a piece of POSTER BOARD off the floor and       shows it to Master Mind.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 I even designed us some new                 costumes.              The picture is crudely drawn with magic markers and crayons.       A big headed man (Master Mind) is standing on a plate of       grass in a blue costume with a picture of a brain on his       chest.              Next to him, is a picture of Titan in a red costume with a       black cape, but his chest is mysteriously blank.              Titan proudly points to the two figures.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 See, you'd be brain, so you got a                 little one on your costume, and                 then I'll have brawn on mine...once                 I figure out the best, you know,                 visual interpretation of it. What                 do you think?                                  MASTER MIND                 What do I think?              Master Mind shakes his head tiredly.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 I think you're probably the biggest                 idiot I've ever met. I mean, I                 can't believe you. All your gifts,                 all your powers, and all you want                 to use them for is your own                 financial fulfillment. You know                 what? Your kind of people make me                 sick.              Titan puts down his drawing.                                  TITAN                 I worked hard on this.                                  MASTER MIND                 Oh - gee - I am so sorry!                                                               78.                            Master Mind looks to Heaven in disgust.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                     (under his breath)                 Of all the people to pick, it had                 to be this loser.              This strikes a cord with Titan.                                  TITAN                 Now, hold on. You're going a little                 too far.                                  MASTER MIND                 I wish your mother said that to                 your father the night of your                 conception, they would have saved                 me a whole lot of heartache.                                  TITAN                 Hey, I mean it.              Master Mind gets right in his face.                                  MASTER MIND                 Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do?              EXT. HAL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY              We see Master Mind's body CRASH through the building and land       in a DUMPSTER across the street.              A car pulls up. The driver's door opens. Da Vinci gets out       and runs to help his master.                                    DA VINCI                 Master!                                    MASTER MIND (O.S.)                 It hurts.              Da Vinci peeks into the dumpster to see Master Mind's body       cushioned by a stack of trash bags.                                  DA VINCI                 What hurts?                                    MASTER MIND                 It!              The overly large henchmen starts to pull his master from the       dumpster when they suddenly hear a voice from above. It's       Titan peeking through the hole in his apartment wall.                                                                  79.                                                TITAN                 I don't need you, I don't need                 anybody. I have the power to do and                 take anything I want. And now, I'm                 gonna take back everything this                 city owes me. Beware Metro City,                 it's time for Titan to collect.              Titan shoots up into the air.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 Oh, and from now on - I'M GONNA FLY                 THE WAY I WANT TO FLY!              He takes a sitting position and flies away as if he were       piloting an invisible jet.              Master Mind climbs out of the dumpster and watches Titan       disappear into the distance.                                  DA VINCI                 How'd the plan go, boss?                                  MASTER MIND                 I just made myself redundant, old                 friend.              Da Vinci gives Master Mind a whiff.                                  DA VINCI                 It's not that bad.              INT. BANK - DAY              Titan, with a happy bounce in his step, enters the bank. The       last time he was here he thwarted a robbery. He looks       nostalgic.              A SECURITY GUARD shyly walks up to him like a kid meeting his       TV idol.                                  SECURITY GUARD                 Morning, Tighten.                                   TITAN                 Morning.                                  SECURITY GUARD                 Is there something we can do for                 you?                                                                  80.                                                   TITAN                    Oh, don't bother about me. I'm just                    here to make a withdrawal.              Titan walks across the lobby, drawing stares of admiration       from all.              A little girl waves to him sweetly. He gives her a good-       natured WINK as he heads straight for the vault.              The security guard watches him enter and come out with a SACK       OF CASH.              Sure he must be misunderstanding what's going on, the       security guard just stares at Titan as he passes by and out       the door.              The bank manager comes over to the guard.                                     BANK MANAGER                    Say, did he just rob us?                                     SECURITY GUARD                    Not sure. Sort of looks it, don't                    it?                                     BANK MANAGER                    Yeah.                                     SECURITY GUARD                    Should I, you know, stop him?                                     BANK MANAGER                    Umm...Yeah.              As the security guard exits the bank, the manager stares out       the window. His eyes suddenly grow wide with terror.              The guard's body suddenly smashes through the window, landing       at the startled bank manager's feet.                                     BANK MANAGER (CONT'D)                        (looking down at the                         guard)                    He did rob us, didn't he?

BRAD HELMS                 ""Absolute power corrupts                 absolutely."" When Lord Acton stated                 that, in a letter to Bishop Mandell                 Creighton in 1887, no one thought                 much about it, but today Metro City                 is reeling from that very prophecy.                 Tighten, who many thought of as our                 savior, has turned his back on the                 cause of justice.                                                        CUT TO:              TITAN BEING EVIL - MONTAGE              EXT. DIAMOND EXCHANGE - DAY              Titan flies through the window of the building. He emerges       seconds later laughing with his shirt full of booty.              EXT. CITY STREET - DAY              A woman screams from the window of a BURNING BUILDING. Titan       flies up to her, grabs her fur coat and zooms off again,       leaving the woman behind, slightly confused.              EXT. OUTSIDE MARKET - DAY              Titan steals a little boy's lollipop and gooses his mother.              EXT. CITY STREET - DAY              Dozens of people run through the streets apparently to get       out of a downpour. We cut to the top of a building and see       Titan ZIPPING UP HIS PANTS and laughing.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT              Master Mind paces back and forth in front of Plato and Da       Vinci.                                  PLATO                 I don't understand it. He seemed to                 have every characteristic we were                 looking for in a superhero.                                  MASTER MIND                 Well, there's no use crying about                 it now, we must take action. I'm                 not going to play second fiddle to                 that crass buffoon. We must destroy                 Tighten.                                                                  82.                                                PLATO                 It won't be easy. Uberman had a                 sense of decency and genuine love                 for the people. That was his                 weakness and was easily used                 against him.                                  MASTER MIND                 Yes, but he possesses the same                 flaws present in Uberman's DNA -                 copper. It's like Benjamin Franklin                 always said: ""If something works                 don't dick with it.""              EXT. BAR - DAY              It looks like a war zone passed through here. Smashed police       cars and debris lay everywhere. This seems to be the only       building left untouched.              INT. BAR - DAY              A very tipsy Titan is sitting at the bar, looking deep into       the bottom of his beer glass for answers.                                  TITAN                 I can have anything I want. I'm                 like a god.              The BARTENDER just listens as he wipes down a glass with a       dirty rag.                                  TITAN                 Point to any woman in this bar. I                 could have her in a second.              He follows the bartender's gaze to THE ONLY OTHER PERSON       THERE - A passed out, MIDDLE AGED HAG OF A BARFLY.                                  TITAN                     (to Old Barfly)                 Hey, you wanna get with this?                                  BARTENDER                 Buddy, what do you want?              Titan carefully considers this for a moment.                                  TITAN                 What do you want? That's the                 question, isn't it. I mean, what do                 you want when you can have                 everything?                           (MORE)                                                                 83.                           TITAN(cont'd)                 I suppose what I really want is to                 never be forgotten again. I want to                 do something that can never be cast                 aside or one-upped. I want a -                 what's it called? - A legacy. I                 want a legacy. Yeah, that's it. I                 like the sound that.                                  BARTENDER                 I meant, what do you want to drink?                                  TITAN                 Oh.              EXT. BAR - LATER              Titan stumbles out of the bar, carrying a large sack of       money.                                  MASTER MIND (O.S.)                 Your time has come to an end,                 Titan!              He looks up to see Master Mind suddenly standing before him.                                  TITAN                 What?                                  MASTER MIND                 There can be only one master                 criminal in this city - and it's                 me.                                  TITAN                 Really?              Titan melodramatically throws up his arms.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 I guess I should leave town then,                 huh?                                  MASTER MIND                 I have a better idea - NOW!              Two floors up Da Vinci releases a rope. A COPPER CAGE, like       the one that caged Uberman, drops down on top of Titan.              Titan nonchalantly surveys the cage. He walks to the bars,       tries to pull them apart but can't.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 That's copper my good man. Your one                 weakness.                           (MORE)                                                                 84.                           MASTER MIND(cont'd)                 For all your amazing gifts of brawn                 you are no match for my intellect.              Titan thinks for a moment. Suddenly, he starts to SPIN like a       human top, DRILLING HIMSELF INTO THE STREET BELOW.              As he disappears beneath the surface, we see a shocked look       on Master Mind's face until Titan suddenly explodes out from       under the street in front of him.              Master Mind stares up at him, dumbfounded.              Titan makes like he's going to strike him down, but stops.                                  TITAN                 You know what? You're nothing but a                 bug. Not even worth my effort.              He turns his back to Master Mind and continues down the       street.              Plato makes his way from the shadows to join his master. They       watch Titan shrink into the distance.                                  MASTER MIND                 He's not as dumb as I thought.                                  PLATO                 I guess not...Funny, though.                                  MASTER MIND                 What's funny?                                  PLATO                 Funny Uberman didn't think of the                 same thing.              EXT. HIGH ABOVE METRO CITY - DAY              As Titan flies, he looks down at the rooftops of the city       below.              Suddenly, something catches his attention.                                     HAL                 That's it!              He stops, hovering in place as he looks down below.              The buildings, which make up the heart of downtown Metro, are       in a PERFECT TRIANGLE with a long strip of street leading up       to it. It sorta looks like a bowling lane.                                                                 85.                                                HAL                 Hello, Legacy.              EXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY              Vinnie and his goons come running out as the hear a       COMMOTION.              They look up to see Titan ripping off THE GIANT BOWLING BALL       from the top of the establishment.                                  VINNIE                 Hey, that's my ball!              INT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY              Roxanne enters the building's elevator. Just before the door       closes an ELDERLY WOMAN slides in.                                  ELDERLY WOMAN                 That was a close one. Sixth floor,                 please.              Roxanne smiles and goes to press the button.              The elderly woman suddenly pulls out a SPRAY CAN, shooting a       MYSTERIOUS-LOOKING MIST into Roxanne's face. She falls to the       floor unconscious.              INT. ROXANNE'S APARTMENT - DAY              Roxanne awakens, finding herself tied to a chair in her       living room.              We hear NOISE from a TV in the background as she tries to       adjust her vision.              Slowly, the blurry figure before her becomes clear.              It's Master Mind. He sits on her Lazy-Boy, reading what looks       to be some kind of JOURNAL.                                  MASTER MIND                 Wow, I always thought Uberman was                 your first superhero - but it looks                 like our little Roxanne dated a                 linebacker in college.                                  ROXANNE                 That's my diary.                                    MASTER MIND                 So it is.                                                                  86.                                                ROXANNE                 It's personal.                                  MASTER MIND                 Well, then I wouldn't leave it in                 your underwear drawer for just                 anyone to find.              He throws the diary over his shoulder.                                  ROXANNE                 What do you want?                                  MASTER MIND                 I need your help.                                  ROXANNE                 So you knock me out and tie me to a                 chair?                                  MASTER MIND                 You're not going to like what I'm                 about to tell you.              As she tries to shake off her headache from being knocked       unconscious, Roxanne spots something on the TV.              ON TELEVISION              Brad Helms is huddled behind a van.                                  BRAD HELMS                 It's chaos here in city square as                 city police -              Behind him, Titan picks up a POLICE CAR and throws it at a       PADDY WAGON. Both vehicles EXPLODE on impact.              BACK TO SCENE                                  ROXANNE                 He's really out of control.                                  MASTER MIND                 Tell me about it.              As if finally realizing something, Roxanne looks back at       Master Mind.                                  ROXANNE                 I should have known. You have                 something to do with this, don't                 you? - With Titan turning evil.                                                               87.                                                MASTER MIND                 Well, the evil thing he did by                 himself. My goal was to give MYSELF                 purpose by creating an intellectual                 sparring partner.                                  ROXANNE                     (confused)                 You're talking like you made him.                                  MASTER MIND                 And they call me Master Mind.                                  ROXANNE                 Let me get this straight. You                 missed getting your ass kicked, so                 you made a new guy to kick your                 ass. That's pathetic.                                  MASTER MIND                 In hindsight...              Roxanne turns back to the TV to see a group of POLICE       OFFICERS open fire on Titan. The bullets just deflect off his       chest.                                  ROXANNE                 And his powers, they're just like                 Uberman's. Why would he have his                 powers?                                  MASTER MIND                     (almost ashamed)                 I had some left over from                 something. I infused him with it.                                  ROXANNE                 YOU DID WHAT!?              Driven by rage, she struggles to tear out of her bonds. She       finally relents, giving Master Mind a look fueled by pure       hatred.                                  MASTER MIND                 Yeah, that's why I decided to tie                 you up.                                  ROXANNE                 You did all this because you wanted                 purpose?                                  MASTER MIND                 He seemed nice.                                                                  88.                            TELEVISION              Titan is standing on top of a destroyed police car. He waves       for the camera to zoom in on him.                                     TITAN                    Closer. I want to show the people                    my real face.              He pulls off his mask, revealing himself as Hal Stewart to       the public for the first time.                                     TITAN (CONT'D)                    Recognize me?              BACK TO SCENE                                     ROXANNE                    Hal Stewart. He's the guy we                    thought saved that woman and kid.                    Turned out he was just trying to                    save his own ass.                                     MASTER MIND                    Yeah, good to know - NOW!              TELEVISION              Titan throws the mask over this shoulder and hops off the       car.                                     TITAN                    That's right, I'm really Hal                    Stewart. Former hero and bowling                    teacher at Kingpin's Bowling.              BACK TO SCENE              Roxanne turns to Master Mind, condescending him with her       eyes.                                      ROXANNE                    You picked a bowler to give super                    powers to?                                     MASTER MIND                    It's a modest profession!              TELEVISION                                                               89.                                                TITAN                 With my new found power, I've                 recently started to wonder what                 sort of legacy I should leave.                 Should I be a hero? I tried that                 once before - even saved a lady and                 her baby from being squashed. I was                 treated like a god until everyone                 started to shit on me - Okay, so                 what if I didn't ""purposely"" save                 them!              He walks over and puts his hand on a large circular concrete       shape just off camera.                                  TITAN                 Well, I'm going to make something                 that can't be taken away from me.                 I'm going to create a permanent                 monument to my greatness. One that                 won't be so easily forgotten or                 erased.              The camera pulls back revealing THE GIANT CONCRETE BOWLING       BALL from Kingpin's.                                  TITAN                 I intend to create a new category                 in the Guinness Book of World's                 Records by rolling the biggest                 strike in the history of bowling.              He grabs the camera and points it to the DOWNTOWN BUILDINGS.       We realize they are PERFECTLY ALIGNED IN BOWLING PIN       FORMATION.                                  TITAN                 My thanks to the city planning                 commission. This wouldn't have been                 possible without them.              Titan grabs the camera so it's pointing back at him again.                                  TITAN                 Tell your friends and family to                 tune in right here to this station                 at noon tomorrow.              BACK TO SCENE                                  ROXANNE                 My god, he's nuts. That'll destroy                 the whole business triangle.                                                               90.                            Master Mind seems to be contemplating something - something       bad.                                     ROXANNE                 What?                                  MASTER MIND                 My lair is in the direct path of                 the ball.                                  ROXANNE                 Oh, real nice. Wouldn't want                 anything to happen to your hideout,                 would we?                                  MASTER MIND                 You don't understand. I have                 certain equipment that's - that's                 highly unstable.                                  ROXANNE                 What do you mean?                                  MASTER MIND                 I sort of have a hydrogen reactor,                 okay?                                  ROXANNE                 A HYDROGEN reactor?                                  MASTER MIND                 It's experimental - only one in the                 world...Well, how do you think I                 power all my inventions? Someone                 like me can't pay for electricity.                 The bills would be outrageous.                                     ROXANNE                 A REACTOR?                                  MASTER MIND                 It creates 100 times the output of                 a nuclear one...If destroyed it                 could...                                  ROXANNE                 - Vaporize the entire city!                                  MASTER MIND                     (proudly)                 Pshaw...the whole eastern seaboard,                 actually. That little baby is                 amazing. I'm quite proud of it.                           (MORE)                                                                91.                           MASTER MIND(cont'd)                     (off her deadpan reaction)                 I mean...we'd better find a way to                 stop him.              Master Mind thinks a moment.                                  MASTER MIND                 Did Uberman have a hideout?                                  ROXANNE                 What?                                  MASTER MIND                 A cave, a solitary fortress of some                 kind. C'mon, all heros have a place                 to hang their capes up in. Roxanne,                 it may be our only chance to find                 something, a clue, anything that                 could give us a fighting chance.                                  ROXANNE                 It's under his house.                                  MASTER MIND                 Whose house?              Roxanne can hardly believe what she's telling him.                                  ROXANNE                 Wayne Scott's.              Master Mind shoots up out of his chair.                                  MASTER MIND                 Wayne Scott? Uberman was Wayne                 Scott!? Wayne Scott, the wealthy                 philanthropist? But he disappeared -                                   ROXANNE                      (interrupting)                 He disappeared just over two months                 ago when you killed him. Not only                 did you rid the world of a hero,                 you killed a kind, noble, generous                 man.              Perhaps ashamed, the super villain hangs his head.              Master Mind walks behind Roxanne and undoes her bonds.              Rubbing her wrists, she watches him as he walks over to the       door.                                                                  92.                                                ROXANNE (CONT'D)                 Looks like you got what you always                 wanted. Uberman is out of the                 picture and Metro City is doomed.              He grabs the door knob and stops, considering her words.                                  MASTER MIND                 ""Metro City doomed."" You know, I                 never thought I'd say something                 like this, but here it goes -              He slowly turns to her, CUE HEROIC MUSIC.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Not if I have anything to say about                 it.              EXT. WAYNE SCOTT'S MANSION - NIGHT              Master Mind stands before the huge, Gothic structure in awe.                                  MASTER MIND                 Such a dark place for one such as                 you. I wonder, underneath your                 noble deeds, what inner demons                 drove you to your endless crusade                 for justice?              He walks to the front entrance. The double doors have been       sealed shut with boards and nails. Master Mind begins to tear       them off with his metal hand.              INT. WAYNE SCOTT'S MANSION - NIGHT              The doors opens. A beam of moonlight immediately pierces the       darkness, forming an illuminated path into the heart of the       manor.              Master Mind enters.              Covered in dust and cobwebs, the hall looks like a gigantic       crypt.                                  MASTER MIND                 Good lord, man. You've only been                 dead for two months.              Master Mind walks, coming to a gigantic painted PORTRAIT OF       WAYNE SCOTT. He stops to reverently admire the image of his       fallen foe.                                                                  93.                                                 MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                  A disguise so simple, it's                  ingenious. No wonder I never caught                  on.              Besides the Armani suit, there's nothing to hide the fact       that this is the same person as Uberman. In the picture, he's       even standing in the same cheesy, heroic pose with his fists       on his hips.                                   MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                  Two lives, yet in both you were an                  ideal. Perhaps it was you who was                  victorious in the end, old friend.              A BONGING sound suddenly bellows through the dark halls.              Master Mind comes to a grandfather clock standing next to a       gigantic BOOKCASE.              On the twelfth bong it falls silent.              Master Mind begins to slide it across the floor until he       hears a loud CLICK.              The bookcase slides into the wall, REVEALING A HIDDEN       PASSAGE.                                   MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                  I'll miss how predictable you were.              The passage way leads Master Mind to a WORKING ESCALATOR.              Master Mind gets off the escalator to see a long hallway with       stone walls.              He begins to hear strange SOUNDS, almost like MUFFLED       SCREAMS, coming from a doorway at the end of the hallway.              Master Mind starts walking towards it. As he steps closer, he       begins to notice a light cracking through the bottom of the       door.                                   MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                  Hello? Anyone here...besides..all                  the BIG MEN who are with me now?              Nothing.                                   MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                      (to himself)                  What's the worst you're gonna find?                            (MORE)                                                                  94.                           MASTER MIND(cont'd)                 The man was a boy scout, not a                 serial killer.              He opens the door to his immediate amazement.              It's some kind of screening room. A PROJECTOR shoots an image       onto A DIRTY WHITE SCREEN hanging on the wall. BEER CANS       litter the floor; a table in front of a ripped-up couch is       covered in discarded snack goods; and a Kiss Pinball machine       stands in the far corner next to a CLOSED DOOR.              Master Mind turns his attention to the action on the screen.              SCREEN              A woman dressed in a leather DOMINATRIX OUTFIT is whipping an       overweight man lying on a swing-like device with his butt       sticking out.                                  DOMINATRIX IN FILM                 YOU ARE A WORM!              She whips him three times. The man CRIES out in pain.                                  FAT MAN IN FILM                 PINEAPPLE!!! PINEAPPLE!!!              Master Mind's eyes are transfixed on the disturbing imagery.              The door by the pinball machine suddenly swings open.              WAYNE SCOTT, dressed in raggedy sweats, steps into the room       carrying a CAN OF BEER and a bowl of JIFFY-POP.              Master Mind cannot believe his horrified eyes.                                   MASTER MIND                 Ahhhhhh!              Wayne Scott is just as startled.                                   WAYNE SCOTT                 Jesus!              He drop his drink and snack to the floor.              The two men stare at each other as they struggle to regain       their normal breathing patterns.              Wayne Scott walks over to the couch, brushes off a thick       layer of chip crumbs, and sits down.                                  WAYNE SCOTT (CONT'D)                 What the hell are you doing here?                                                                  95.                                                MASTER MIND                 I might just ask you the same                 question. I had thought I                 incinerated you.                                   WAYNE SCOTT                 You scared the bejesus out of me.                 How'd you figure out I was still                 alive? Wait, how do you know my                 identity!?                                  MASTER MIND                 Roxanne told me. As for your ruse,                 I forgot to line the bottom of the                 copper cage - Somebody pointed that                 out to me recently. Figured if they                 could do it, so could you. But one                 thing I couldn't figure out -                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 The skeleton? Something I                 ""borrowed"" from a medical school a                 few months before.                                  MASTER MIND                 A few months? How long had you been                 planning this?                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 I always planned to retire -                 eventually. I mean, come on, you                 can't do this sort of thing in your                 fifties. You'd just look                 ridiculous.              The pieces of the puzzle appear to be coming together in       Master Mind's head.                                  MASTER MIND                 I see it all so clearly now.              INT. MASTER MIND'S HYDROFOIL - FLASHBACK              Master Mind and his minions cover their eyes as the       observatory explodes.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D - V.O.)                 You must have done it just seconds                 before the observatory exploded.                                                                 96.                            INT. OBSERVATORY - FLASHBACK              Similar to what Titan did, Uberman bores out from under the       cage.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D - V.O.)                 You bore out from under the cage.                 Then, using your Uber-Speed, -              EXT. OBSERVATORY - FLASHBACK              Running in a blur-like haze, Uberman screeches to a halt in       front of some bushes.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D - V.O.)                 - you made your way to safety,                 where you had the skeleton safely                 hidden away somewhere.              EXT OBSERVATORY - SKY - DAY              Uberman soars high above the clouds. He looks down at the       observatory, which is a mere speck in the distance.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D - V.O) (CONT'D)                 Then you must have flown to a safe                 distance and waited for the                 explosion, then...              Just as the observatory explodes Uberman aims and throws the       SKELETON like a javelin.              It soars through the air like a missile, tearing through the       flames of the explosion, and crashing right into the       windshield of Master Mind's hydrofoil.              END OF FLASHBACK              Wayne stares at Master Mind, clearly impressed.                                  WAYNE                 Man, you ARE smart.                                   MASTER MIND                 But why fake your death? Why go                 through all of it? You could have                 just quit.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 But the responsibility would still                 be there.                           (MORE)                                                               97.                           WAYNE SCOTT(cont'd)                 A cop can retire and stop handing                 out speeding tickets - but people                 expect more from superheroes. I                 tell you, a volcano couldn't erupt                 in Zimbabwe without everyone                 expecting me to do something about                 it. I figured, out of sight, out of                 mind.                                   MASTER MIND                 And Wayne Scott? Why did he have to                 disappear?                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Both of my lives have so much                 baggage. It's time for new baggage,                 you know?              Master Mind's is absolutely flabbergasted.                                  MASTER MIND                 I just can't believe it. This whole                 time you've been in hiding while a                 force of great evil is tearing your                 city apart?              Wayne rises to his feet, waving his hands for Master Mind to       say no more.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 I don't want to hear about it.                 That's why I don't have a                 television in here to remind me of                 all the things I SHOULD be doing.                 Hell, I could get a wife to do                 that.                                  MASTER MIND                 There's a demented supervillain out                 there about to destroy our - I                 mean, your city.              Wayne shrugs indifferently.                                  MASTER MIND                 You're really going to do nothing?                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Good and evil have a way of                 balancing themselves out. If this                 guy is as bad as you say, somebody                 will rise up to fight him. It's                 just the order of things. You found                 me, didn't you?                                                                 98.                            Wayne puts a condescending hand on Master Mind's shoulder.                                  WAYNE SCOTT (CONT'D)                 I know it's hard, but you'll find                 someone else someday.              He then starts walking to the door.                                  MASTER MIND                 You're the only one who can stop                 him.              Wayne turns around.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Couldn't if I wanted to. Gotta a                 plane to catch.                                    MASTER MIND                 A plane?                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Going to Barbados for a little                 change in climate. Now, if you'll                 excuse me, I got to go pack.              He reads the still defeated look on Master Mind's face.                                  WAYNE SCOTT (CONT'D)                 You were a good foe. I'm sorry if                 I've let you down. If it makes a                 difference, you were the best foe a                 hero could ask for.                                  MASTER MIND                 Not smart enough to come up with a                 full-proof trap.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Well, you did almost have me when                 you figured out my weakness was                 copper. Now that made me sweat a                 little. Took me way too long to                 drill out from under that cage.                                  MASTER MIND                 I got lucky.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Anyway, it's a good thing for my                 sake that I could always count on                 you for an out.                                                               99.                                                MASTER MIND                     (suddenly confused)                 What do you mean?                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 C'mon, we always threw each other a                 couple of bones. You would always                 leave me an out in one of your                 `full-proof' traps, and I'd never                 had you incarcerated at a                 penitentiary that you couldn't                 eventually escape from. It kept our                 little game going.              Master Mind seems deflated.                                  MASTER MIND                 Game? - Was that all this ever was                 to you? You know, I was trying my                 best every time I fought you. Those                 `outs' as you call them were                 unintentional.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Oh.                                  MASTER MIND                 I guess I was never really a match                 for you, was I?              Wayne shrugs.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                     (thoughtfully)                 Then how can I expect to be one for                 Titan?              A beaten man, Master Mind heads for the door, but stops and       turns around.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 What about Roxanne?              Wayne unleashes an exhausted sigh.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 I think we both got what we wanted                 out of our relationship. She got a                 career out of me, and I got plenty                 of other things out of her. But I'm                 ready to move on to greener                 pastures.                                                                 100.                            Master Mind's steel hand clinches into a fist at his side.       Wayne's oblivious to this.                                  MASTER MIND                 I guess I wasn't the villain I                 thought I was, and you...you                 weren't the hero I thought you                 were.              He turns to make his exit when he suddenly sees ROXANNE       STANDING IN THE DOOR FRAME.              Wayne is almost at a loss for words.                                  WAYNE SCOTT                 Roxanne! How long have you been...                                  ROXANNE                 Long enough.              Roxanne looks at Master Mind.                                   ROXANNE (CONT'D)                 Don't you have something else you                 can go do?              Master Mind leaves Roxanne and Wayne facing each other in       silence.              EXT. ANOTHER BAR - DAY              Titan emerges with Brad and Frank. He's holding a BEER CAN       and a bag of PORK RINDS.                                  TITAN                 Alright, I want this whole thing to                 look ESPN professional, understand?              A distant MECHANIZED RUMBLE can be heard. The noise rises,       signaling the approach of something powerful.              Titan and his crew walk out to the center of the plaza as the       sound becomes almost deafening.              A TANK TRACK              as it moves over the street. We PULL BACK to see a whole line       of TANKS rolling along the street.              PLAZA              From the five streets branching off the plaza, a dozen tanks       roll toward Titan.                                                                 101.                            Titan turns to Brad and Frank.                                     TITAN (CONT'D)                    You guys are about to get some good                    footage. I might need a little                    room, though.              Brad and Frank look at each other and run to take cover       behind a nearby building.              Meanwhile, Titan nonchalantly sips from his beer as the tanks       begin to surround them.              FEEDBACK belts out of one of the tank's loudspeaker's,       causing Titan to do a mock wince.                                      TANK LOUDSPEAKER                    Titan, we have orders from the city                    of Metro to take you into custody.                    If you do not give your self up                    willingly, we will be forced to                    open fire.              There's a long pause as no one says anything.                                     TANK LOUDSPEAKER                    What is your answer?              Titan takes a sip of his beverage and UNLEASHES A GIGANTIC       BURP - The shockwave of which sends several of the tanks       flying into a nearby building.              Two of the remaining tanks close in on the villain. Both have       him dead to rights at point-blank range with their massive       guns.              Titan sets down his beer, then calmly plugs a fist into each       barrel.              They FIRE.              The FORCE OF THE BLAST SENDS THEM BOTH FLYING IN OPPOSITE       DIRECTIONS where they CRASH into nearby buildings.              Titan bends down and pick his beet back up.                                     TITAN                        (to beer)                    Miss me?              Titan is suddenly bombarded by a massive barrage of machine-       gun fire. The force sends him flying into the windshield of a       nearby car.                                                                 102.                            He looks up to see an APACHE ASSAULT COPTER. It's nose-       mounted GATLING-GUN is turning toward him.              Titan gets up to his feet and looks down at his beer can. The       bottom of it was blown apart in the blast.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 Didn't mean to get you involved in                 all of this.              He stared daggers up at the helicopter pilot just as the gun       gets a bead on him.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 Hey, man! You killed my suds!              Titan throws the can up and slaps it with the palm of his       hand.              It flies with so much force it knocks the helicopter blade       clean off. The rest of the Apache crashes to the street like       a car dropped off a building.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 That's one was for you, beer.              Titan salutes the wreckage and walks away to find Brad and       Frank still hiding behind the building.                                  TITAN                 Guys, please tell me you got that                 last bit.                                  BRAD HELMS                 Huh?                                  TITAN                 You're kidding me. I give you my                 sexiest moves and you mean to tell                 me it was for nothing?                                  BRAD HELMS                 We were afraid something might hit                 us.                                  TITAN                 Looks like I've given the story of                 the century to the wrong man.              He thinks about this for a moment, then it hits him.                                                              103.                                                TITAN                 Wait. What about that other                 reporter. Blond. Not so lumpy on                 the topper half, but killer legs.                                  BRAD HELMS                 Roxanne. You want Roxanne. She's a                 much better reporter than I am. You                 want her.                                  TITAN                 Where can I find her.                                  FRANK                 We're actually not supposed to give                 out that sort of information.                                  BRAD HELMS                 1314 Mockingbird Lane. I believe                 she lives in a penthouse.                                  TITAN                 You've been very helpful.              He tosses Brad over his shoulder like a discarded ice cream       cone.              In the faint distance we see him splash down in the middle of       the Metro City river.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - DAY              Master Mind, pacing anxiously as Plato and Da Vinci pack       boxes. Obviously Master Mind is going on the lamb.                                  MASTER MIND                 Hurry, we must be on our way as                 soon as possible.

If he's set on destroying us,                 there's precious little we could do                 about it.                                  DA VINCI                 Where are we going?                                                              104.

We'll start over, we'll go back to                 doing what we do best.                                  PLATO                 With our tails between our legs?              The old Master Mind would never have let this comment slip       by, but as we have seen, he's not the same man.                                  MASTER MIND                 Plato, do you have a better plan?!              Master Mind's cell phone rings. He turns in shame from his       men and answers it.

ROXANNE                 What are you going to do about                 Tighten?              INTERCUT between Master Mind and Roxanne on phone.

ROXANNE                 You're running away?                                  MASTER MIND                 In a word - yes.                                  ROXANNE                 You created this monster...                                  MASTER MIND                 I didn't create this - the god's of                 irony did and I am eating the crow                 I so richly deserve.                                  ROXANNE                 There's no time for self pity.                                                              105.

You'll be                 safe.                                  ROXANNE                 I'm not going anywhere.                                  MASTER MIND                 Will you listen to me, no one can                 stop him.                                   ROXANNE                 You have to try. The city needs                 your help.                                  MASTER MIND                 I'm afraid you have an inflated                 opinion of me.                                  ROXANNE                 What the hell's happened to you?                 The Master Mind I knew would never                 have run from a fight even though                 he knew deep in his heart that he                 didn't have a chance in hell of                 winning it. It was your best                 quality. You need to be that man                 right now...I...                                  MASTER MIND                 What?                                  ROXANNE                     (heart felt)                 I believe in you.              Master Mind is taken aback, in a good way. But he catches       himself before the words swell his heart.                                  MASTER MIND                 Sweet words, but that man is dead.                 Please, Roxanne, just come with me.                                  ROXANNE                 No...I guess you are a coward after                 all.              Suddenly, there's a loud crash.                                                                106.                            Roxanne looks up to see a huge hunk of her ceiling has been       completely ripped off.              Titan is flying above, holding the debris as casually as if       it were a paper plate at a barbecue.              He looks down at her and smiles.                                  TITAN                 Man, have I got a story for you.              Master Mind can hears Titan's familiar laugh from his side of       the line.                                  MASTER MIND                 Roxanne? Roxanne?              EXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY              Titan is standing in front of the bowling alley, trying to       decide on an appropriate pose for the occasion.                                  TITAN                 What pose would be best? The corny                 folded arms thing?              He demonstrates, arching his chin proudly in the air.                                  TITAN                 Or maybe on the hips, like this.              It's the classic Superman pose, only not as masculine.                                  TITAN                 No, makes me look like a flamer                 pirate.              As Titan starts to fix his hair in the window, Frank pretends       to fix the lens on his camera as he speaks to Roxanne.                                  FRANK                     (whispering)                 Shouldn't we be making a run for it                 right about now?                                  ROXANNE                     (whispering)                 The guy can outrun bullets. I don't                 think either one of us is in that                 kind of shape.                                  TITAN                 She's right, Frank.                                                              107.                            Frank looks up, stunned that Titan could have possibly heard       him.                                  TITAN                 Also got super hearing. I promise                 not to keep the both of you long,                 but you'll thank me when this is                 all over.              Frank and Roxanne exchange helpless expressions.              INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - DAY              Master Mind reverently stares up at the painted portrait of       his father.                                  MASTER MIND                 Dad, it's me...                     (he looks around to make                      sure no one can hear)                 ...Bubsy. I know we haven't talked                 in a while, and I'm sorry. It's                 been a little crazy trying to live                 up to a legacy.              The painting's menacing stare seems to reach into his very       soul.                                  MASTER MIND                 Anyway...You raised me to be the                 worst that I could possibly be. And                 I've tried to live up to that as                 best as I could - even dropping out                 of dentistry school like you wanted                 me to. But I'm about to do                 something now that would really                 piss you off. I'm going to go                 against everything you ever taught                 me. I hope...I hope that maybe                 you'll look down at what I'm about                 to do as not so much a good deed,                 but more like the outright defiance                 of a hateful and ungrateful, son.                 If you could do that, then maybe -                 in your own little way - you could -                 for probably the first time - find                 a reason to be proud of me.              He looks back up at the picture. Is it our imagination, or       does the painting's stare suddenly seem even angrier?                                                              108.

ROXANNE                 I'm here with the cause of the                 destruction in Metro City. He has                 kidnapped me and a cameraman to                 chronicle what he refers to as the                 creation of a monument to his                 invincibility and overall                 ""Asskickiness.""

Titan suddenly steps into the shot.                                  TITAN                 And I'm going for the biggest                 strike ever.              He leans into the camera.                                  TITAN                 And you, Metro City, have a                 ringside seat as I cement my name                 in the anal of history.

Rookie Hal Stewart,                 a young man with a dream, realizing                 that dream here today, folks.                           (MORE)                                                                 110.                           TITAN(cont'd)                 One might click there heels and say                 ""There's no place like home"" upon                 finding themselves in such a                 fantasy. Well, Hal looks very much                 at home right were he is - with a                 ball in hand and glory in his                 sights.              INT. METRO CITY LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS              In the bowels of Master Mind's hideout, the HYDROGEN REACTOR       glows and HUMS MENACINGLY.              BACK TO SCENE              Roxanne just stand helpless as Frank films away.                                  ROXANNE                 Hal, I know everyone treated you                 like shit, but you don't have to do                 this.                                  TITAN                 You're right. I don't HAVE to do                 anything. Isn't that cool?              Titan lines up his shot.                                  TITAN                 Here's one for the record books!              Titan flies a few feet and rolls the ball down the main       street.              ROXANNE              Her face is utter horror as she watches the inevitable       destruction of Metro City.              As the ball rolls - it demolishes everything in it's wake;       cars, street lamps - windows shatter as the giant concrete       sphere brushes along side buildings.              TITAN              He smiles in anticipation and uses ""body English"" to direct       the ball.              GIANT BOWLING BALL POV              It's nearly halfway to its target.              ROXANNE                                                              111.                            She closes her eyes.              Titan's smile fades. He looks around as if he hears something       we don't.              About two hundred feet in front of the first building a GIANT       SPIDER WEB flies across the path of the ball, creating a       defensive barrier. An enormous letter ""M"" is etched in the       web's center.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 What the...?              The ball breaks through the web, but it's speed is greatly       reduced.                                  FRANK                 Look, what's that flying in the                 air?              We suddenly see MASTER MIND FLYING OVER THE ROLLING BALL IN A       JET PACK.              He quickly pulls out his goo gun and starts laying down a       path of sticky plasm to stop the destructive sphere's path.                                  MASTER MIND                 C'mon, slow down              Master Mind looks down to see the meter of the gun close to       empty.                                     MASTER MIND                 C'mon.              The ball slows drastically then starts rolling to the side.       It heads off an embankment and rolls harmlessly into a CANAL.                                  MASTER MIND                 Gutterball!              TITAN              He's furious to say the least.                                     TITAN                 YOU!              Master Mind gives him a mocking grin.                                  MASTER MIND                 Bowling? What other trailer park                 sports can you play?                                                                 112.                                                  TITAN                   You are becoming a real pain in my                   ass. I should have done this a long                   time ago.              Titan lunges at his tormentor. Master Mind hits the BOOSTER       on his jet pack and heads back toward the other side of the       city with Titan in hot pursuit.                                    MASTER   MIND (CONT'D)                       (into walkie   talkie)                   Plato, Da Vinci.   Secure Roxanne,                   he's falling for   it.              ELSEWHERE              A flustered Titan lands. He begins searching the city       streets, but Master Mind is nowhere in sight.              He turns upon hearing an EEKING sound to his left.              Sitting on the ground is a CHIMPANZEE wearing a strange       collar. It smiles at him.                                    TITAN                   What the hell?              From behind, Titan is immediately set upon by five more RADIO       CONTROLLED APES.                                      TITAN (CONT'D)                   GODAMNIT!              The critters bite hop and hit Titan. As soon as he throws one       off two more jump him.              Titan breaks free and with his mighty breath blows them       across the street into a fruit stand. With Titan out of their       sight they begin to attack the fruit.              MASTER MIND              He's a block away frantically hitting his remote.                                    MASTER MIND                   Shit! Stupid monkeys and their                   fruit.              Titan flies away from the mad monkeys and lands to find       Master Mind sitting on the ground wrapped in a long cape with       only his head sticking out.                                                              113.                                                TITAN (CONT'D)                 No more games.              Titan FIRES HIS LASER VISION AT MASTER MIND's CHEST.              Master Mind pulls the cloak away to reveal a FIRE HYDRANT.       Titan's EYE LASERS burn through the hydrant releasing a high       pressure stream of water.              Master Mind uses the last remote which dumps two tons of       CEMENT mix into the truck.              The crowd, police and news crews move in closer when Titan       doesn't emerge.              Master Mind drops his last remote and walks toward the truck       cautiously.                                  MASTER MIND                 Could it really be that easy--              - BOOM - The back of the truck explodes, throwing dust and       concrete everywhere. When the dust clears we see and enraged       Titan.                                  MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                 Didn't think so.              As the villain walks toward him, he pulls back his fist to       give Master Mind the killing blow.                                  TITAN                 If you don't mind, I'm going to                 punch trough your face now.              Preparing himself for the end, Master Mind shuts his eyes as       a SUDDEN GUST OF WIND BEGINS TO PICK UP.              AS Titan goes to strike, a BLURRY FIGURE RUNS IN AND SNATCHES       MASTER MIND OUT OF THE AWAY.              Stunned, Master Mind begins to feel around his body as if to       make sure everything's still in place.                                     MASTER MIND                 I'm alive.              He turns to see UBERMAN standing next to him.                                     MASTER MIND                 Uberman?                                                              114.                            The terrified bystanders start to notice the figure standing       next to Master Mind.                                  BYSTANDER 1                 It's Uberman!                                  BYSTANDER 2                 Uberman's alive!                                  BYSTANDER 3                 We're saved!              As the CROWD CHEERS, A confused Master Mind turns to Metro       City's newly resurrected champion.                                     MASTER MIND                 I thought.                                     UBERMAN                 So did I.              He puts a hand on Master Mind's shoulder.                                  UBERMAN                 Thank you, old enemy.                                     MASTER MIND                 For what?                                  UBERMAN                 Showing me the error of my ways,                 Showing me I'm meant to be this                 city's savior, showing me that,                 while we can try, there is no                 running away from our true destiny.              With that, UBERMAN IS STRICKEN BY A LASER BLAST, INSTANTLY       TURNING HIM INTO A CHARRED HUMAN SKELETON.              Master Mind turns to see Titan smiling with his STILL SMOKING       EYES.                                  TITAN                 Oh...Did I interrupt something?              Master Mind turns to run, but, suddenly Titan is before him.                                  TITAN                 Where you going, buddy?              Titan grabs Master Mind by the collar and throws him across       the street into a parked car.                                                                 115.                                                TITAN (CONT'D)                 Welcome to Paintown. Population:                 you.              Master Mind manages to stand on shaky legs. He seems in a       daze, unable to move.              Titan flies up in the air.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 Time to finish this.              With his fist front and center, Titan speeds toward Master       Mind. He's like a human torpedo, coming in for the killing       blow.              Master Mind comes to his senses and puts up his hands.                                  MASTER MIND                 WAIT!!!              Titan screeches to a halt and stops just in front of him like       an old Warner Bros cartoon.                                  TITAN                 What?                                  MASTER MIND                 Quick joke - What's the capital of                 Thailand?                                  TITAN                 Huh - I don't know.                                  MASTER MIND                 It's bang cock!              In a sudden surge of strength, MASTER MIND PUNCHES TITAN IN       THE GROIN.              The once mighty man instantly drops to his knees, searching,       with tears in his eyes, for the proper word to express the       pain suddenly surging through his member.                                  TITAN (CONT'D)                 Ow.              Baffled, he looks up at Master Mind's hand and sees his       gauntlet is now made ENTIRELY OUT OF COPPER.                                   MASTER MIND                 So, I guess pennies are good for                 something.                                                              116.                            He punches Titan in the face, knocking him out cold.              Master Mind looks down on Titan with more than a little       pride. Suddenly he hears something behind him. He spins to       see the crowd making a strange noise - APPLAUSE.              Roxanne comes up to him.              The crowd starts to go wild and cheers for Master Mind. He's       not sure what to make of it.                                  ROXANNE                 Pretty strange, huh?                                  MASTER MIND                 They're cheering for me.                                  ROXANNE                 You saved them. You saved                 everybody. How's it feel?              Master Mind looks at the smiles all around him. He begins to       well up a little.                                  MASTER MIND                 It's a...it's nice, you know? I                 usually don't get a lot of                 feedback.                     (whispering)                 But I also kind of caused all this.                 What happens when they find that                 out I was the cause of some of                 this?              Roxanne looks at the cheering crowd, then back at Master       Mind.                                  ROXANNE                 What they don't know won't hurt                 them.                                  MASTER MIND                 I guess that is all in the past.                                  ROXANNE                 You're the hero.                                  MASTER MIND                 I don't think I'd go that far...I                 mean I just...er...                                  ROXANNE                 Master Mind?                                                              117.                                                   MASTER MIND                    Yes?                                     ROXANNE                    Stop talking.              She kisses him.              The crowd erupts in a cheer.              TELEVISION              The channel 7 he channel 7 logo zooms in followed by the       title ""Eye on Metro City.""              A picture of Master Mind smiling appears on the screen behind       her.                                     SAMANTHA SUMMERS                    Who's bad? Well, not Master Mind.                    It seems the former villain has                    done a career 180 after defeating                    Tighten and saving Metro City from                    certain enslavement. And here he is                    getting a full pardon by Metro                    City's Mayor, Steve Dent.              Cut to ceremony on capital steps. The MAYOR is shaking Master       Mind's metal gauntlet when it suddenly STARTS TO CRUSH HIS       HAND.                                     MAYOR                    Ahhh!              Secret service men quickly start to draw their weapons and       take aim at Master Mind.              Realizing what's happening, he quickly lets the mayor's hand       go and puts his arms in the air.                                     MASTER MIND                    Sorry - Metal hand. Force of habit.              He elbows the mayor.                                     MASTER MIND (CONT'D)                     We're okay, right?              Wincing, the mayor signals the men to put their guns down.              WE CUT to video of Titan behind bars in a regular prison.                                                              118.                                                BRAD HELMS                 And what about Tighten? Is there a                 prison in existence that can hold                 this super powered menace? Well,                 the answer we found is no.              A man in a white lab coat stands in front of Titan's cell       just out of reach.                                  PRISON SCIENTIST                 Of course normally he could break                 out of there anytime, but as you                 can see we've taken some special                 precautions.              The news camera pans over see Titan in his cell wearing a       copper JOCK STRAP with electrical cables hooked to it.              Back to Samantha at the desk.                                  BRAD HELMS                 What is a Hero? It seems never has                 that question needed to be asked                 more than it does tonight. We go to                 our very own Roxanne Ritchi, making                 her triumphant return to our news                 desk for the answer.              Brad turns. The camera pans over to Roxanne who we now see       has been sitting beside him.                                  ROXANNE                 What is a hero? Well, there are                 many different kinds. There are                 those who hear a call, like the                 policeman or doctor, then there's                 the kind the public creates in                 their search for meaning and hope.                 Then, there are those who have the                 courage to change.              DARK ALLEY - NIGHT              A woman is being chased by two large thugs. They're gaining       on her.              She comes to a brick wall - a dead end.              The thugs laugh.                                  THUG #1                 Hey, gimme that purse?                                                              119.                                                MASTER MIND (O.S)                 I don't think it would go with your                 outfit.              The thugs turn around to see Master Mind, standing with his       arms folded across his chest.                                  THUG #2                 It's Master Mind!              Thug #1 draws a knife.                                  THUG #1                 So? It's not like he has any                 superpowers.              Thug #1 puts his fingers to his mouth and whistles.              Suddenly two more Thugs appear behind Master Mind.                                   MASTER MIND                 I'm gonna give you a chance to                 surrender.                                  THUG #1                 Four against one. For a Master                 Mind, you're really bad at math.              Master Mind throws a hand signal up in the air.              Suddenly a giant robotic foot crashes down on the two men       behind him.              Thug #1 and Thug #2 drop their knives and raise their hands       in the air.              Master Mind looks up and waves.                                  MASTER MIND                 Way to take out those two goons,                 guys!              We see Da Vinci and Plato at the wheel of a gigantic robot.                                  DA VINCI                 What two goons?              The giant robot lifts its foot to check the bottom of it's       sole. It KNOCKS OVER WATER TOWER in the process.              The woman looks at Master Mind, horrified.                                             120.                                                MASTER MIND                     (apologetically)                 Sorry, we're new at this.                                                THE END",29,33,29,weather,GitHub

Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.     The bee, of course, flies anyway     because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.     Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.     Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little.     Barry! Breakfast is ready!     Ooming!     Hang on a second.     Hello?     - Barry? - Adam?     - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up.     Looking sharp.     Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.     Sorry. I'm excited.     Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son.     A perfect report card, all B's.     Very proud.     Ma! I got a thing going here.     - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me!     - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye!     Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!     - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry.     - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation.     Never thought I'd make it.     Three days grade school, three days high school.     Those were awkward.     Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive.     You did come back different.     - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.     - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah.     - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going.     Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.     Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead.     I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.     I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.     That's why we don't need vacations.     Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances.     - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are!     - Bee-men. - Amen!     Hallelujah!     Students, faculty, distinguished bees,     please welcome Dean Buzzwell.     Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of...     ...9:15.     That concludes our ceremonies.     And begins your career at Honex Industries!     Will we pick ourjob today?     I heard it's just orientation.     Heads up! Here we go.     Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.     - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary.     Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco     and a part of the Hexagon Group.     This is it!     Wow.     Wow.     We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life     to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.     Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.     Our top-secret formula     is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured     into this soothing sweet syrup     with its distinctive golden glow you know as...     Honey!     - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin!     - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins.     - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive     to improve every aspect of bee existence.     These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.     - What do you think he makes? - Not enough.     Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.     - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey     that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions.     Oan anyone work on the Krelman?     Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know     that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.     But choose carefully     because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.     The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.     What's the difference?     You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off     in 27 million years.     So you'll just work us to death?     We'll sure try.     Wow! That blew my mind!     ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that?     One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make.     I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.     But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?     Why would you question anything? We're bees.     We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.     You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?     Like what? Give me one example.     I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.     Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.     Wait a second. Oheck it out.     - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow.     I've never seen them this close.     They know what it's like outside the hive.     Yeah, but some don't come back.     - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks!     You guys did great!     You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!     - I wonder where they were. - I don't know.     Their day's not planned.     Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.     You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.     Right.     Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.     It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it.     Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.     Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too?     Distant. Distant.     Look at these two.     - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them.     It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.     Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!     He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!     - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out.     What were you doing during this?     Trying to alert the authorities.     I can autograph that.     A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?     Yeah. Gusty.     We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.     - Six miles, huh? - Barry!     A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.     - Maybe I am. - You are not!     We're going 0900 at J-Gate.     What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough?     I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.     Hey, Honex!     Dad, you surprised me.     You decide what you're interested in?     - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one.     Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?     Son, let me tell you about stirring.     You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.     You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing.     You know, Dad, the more I think about it,     maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.     You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?     That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.     Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!     - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny.     You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!     - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me!     Wait till you see the sticks I have.     I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!     Let's open some honey and celebrate!     Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae.     Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!     I'm so proud.     - We're starting work today! - Today's the day.     Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone.     Yeah, right.     Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...     - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left!     One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side.     - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar!     Wow!     Oouple of newbies?     Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!     Make your choice.     - You want to go first? - No, you go.     Oh, my. What's available?     Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.     - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on.     I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.     Wax monkey's always open.     The Krelman opened up again.     What happened?     A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.     Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.     Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!     Oh, this is so hard!     Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,     humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,     mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?     Barry!     All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...     What happened to you? Where are you?     - I'm going out. - Out? Out where?     - Out there. - Oh, no!     I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.     You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?     Another call coming in.     If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd     that gets their roses today.     Hey, guys.     - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?     Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.     It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.     Really? Feeling lucky, are you?     Sign here, here. Just initial that.     - Thank you. - OK.     You got a rain advisory today,     and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain.     So be careful. As always, watch your brooms,     hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.     Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us.     Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!     - That's awful. - And a reminder for you rookies,     bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!     All right, launch positions!     Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!     Black and yellow!     Hello!     You ready for this, hot shot?     Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.     Wind, check.     - Antennae, check. - Nectar pack, check.     - Wings, check. - Stinger, check.     Scared out of my shorts, check.     OK, ladies,     let's move it out!     Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers!     All of you, drain those flowers!     Wow! I'm out!     I can't believe I'm out!     So blue.     I feel so fast and free!     Box kite!     Wow!     Flowers!     This is Blue Leader. We have roses visual.     Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.     Roses!     30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.     Stand to the side, kid. It's got a bit of a kick.     That is one nectar collector!     - Ever see pollination up close? - No, sir.     I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there,     a pinch on that one. See that? It's a little bit of magic.     That's amazing. Why do we do that?     That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.     Oool.     I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow. Oould be daisies. Don't we need those?     Oopy that visual.     Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.     Say again? You're reporting a moving flower?     Affirmative.     That was on the line!     This is the coolest. What is it?     I don't know, but I'm loving this color.     It smells good. Not like a flower, but I like it.     Yeah, fuzzy.     Ohemical-y.     Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby.     My sweet lord of bees!     Oandy-brain, get off there!     Problem!     - Guys! - This could be bad.     Affirmative.     Very close.     Gonna hurt.     Mama's little boy.     You are way out of position, rookie!     Ooming in at you like a missile!     Help me!     I don't think these are flowers.     - Should we tell him? - I think he knows.     What is this?!     Match point!     You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it!     Yowser!     Gross.     There's a bee in the car!     - Do something! - I'm driving!     - Hi, bee. - He's back here!     He's going to sting me!     Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze!     He blinked!     Spray him, Granny!     What are you doing?!     Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable.     I gotta get home.     Oan't fly in rain.     Oan't fly in rain.     Oan't fly in rain.     Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!     Ken, could you close the window please?     Ken, could you close the window please?     Oheck out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure.     You see? Folds out.     Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.     What was that?     Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This...     Drapes!     That is diabolical.     It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.     What's number one? Star Wars?     Nah, I don't go for that...     ...kind of stuff.     No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds.     When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.     There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.     I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it.     I predicted global warming.     I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.     Wait! Stop! Bee!     Stand back. These are winter boots.     Wait!     Don't kill him!     You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me!     Why does his life have less value than yours?     Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement?     I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling.     My brochure!     There you go, little guy.     I'm not scared of him. It's an allergic thing.     Put that on your resume brochure.     My whole face could puff up.     Make it one of your special skills.     Knocking someone out is also a special skill.     Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.     - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.     - You could put carob chips on there. - Bye.     - Supposed to be less calories. - Bye.     I gotta say something.     She saved my life. I gotta say something.     All right, here it goes.     Nah.     What would I say?     I could really get in trouble.     It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human.     I can't believe I'm doing this.     I've got to.     Oh, I can't do it. Oome on!     No. Yes. No.     Do it. I can't.     How should I start it? ""You like jazz?"" No, that's no good.     Here she comes! Speak, you fool!     Hi!     I'm sorry.     - You're talking. - Yes, I know.     You're talking!     I'm so sorry.     No, it's OK. It's fine. I know I'm dreaming.     But I don't recall going to bed.     Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting.     This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee!     I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this,     but they were all trying to kill me.     And if it wasn't for you...     I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised.     That was a little weird.     - I'm talking with a bee. - Yeah.     I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me!     I just want to say I'm grateful. I'll leave now.     - Wait! How did you learn to do that? - What?     The talking thing.     Same way you did, I guess. ""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up.     - That's very funny. - Yeah.     Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with.     Anyway...     Oan I...     ...get you something? - Like what?     I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Ooffee?     I don't want to put you out.     It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.     - It's just coffee. - I hate to impose.     - Don't be ridiculous! - Actually, I would love a cup.     Hey, you want rum cake?     - I shouldn't. - Have some.     - No, I can't. - Oome on!     I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.     - Where? - These stripes don't help.     You look great!     I don't know if you know anything about fashion.     Are you all right?     No.     He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison.     He finally gets there.     He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on.     And he says, ""Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan.     Why would I marry a watermelon?""     Is that a bee joke?     That's the kind of stuff we do.     Yeah, different.     So, what are you gonna do, Barry?     About work? I don't know.     I want to do my part for the hive, but I can't do it the way they want.     I know how you feel.     - You do? - Sure.     My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.     - Really? - My only interest is flowers.     Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan.     Anyway, if you look...     There's my hive right there. See it?     You're in Sheep Meadow!     Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!     No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once.     - Why do girls put rings on their toes? - Why not?     - It's like putting a hat on your knee. - Maybe I'll try that.     - You all right, ma'am? - Oh, yeah. Fine.     Just having two cups of coffee!     Anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee.     Yeah, it's no trouble.     Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life.     Are you...?     Oan I take a piece of this with me?     Sure! Here, have a crumb.     - Thanks! - Yeah.     All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around.     Or not.     OK, Barry.     And thank you so much again... for before.     Oh, that? That was nothing.     Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...     This can't possibly work.     He's all set to go. We may as well try it.     OK, Dave, pull the chute.     - Sounds amazing. - It was amazing!     It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life.     Humans! I can't believe you were with humans!     Giant, scary humans! What were they like?     Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.     They eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy.     - Do they try and kill you, like on TV? - Some of them. But some of them don't.     - How'd you get back? - Poodle.     You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see.     You had your ""experience."" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal.     - Well... - Well?     Well, I met someone.     You did? Was she Bee-ish?     - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you! - No, no, no, not a wasp.     - Spider? - I'm not attracted to spiders.     I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all.     I can't get by that face.     So who is she?     She's... human.     No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law.     - Her name's Vanessa. - Oh, boy.     She's so nice. And she's a florist!     Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!     We're not dating.     You're flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes     with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite!     She saved my life! And she understands me.     This is over!     Eat this.     This is not over! What was that?     - They call it a crumb. - It was so stingin' stripey!     And that's not what they eat. That's what falls off what they eat!     - You know what a Oinnabon is? - No.     It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up...     Sit down!     ...really hot! - Listen to me!     We are not them! We're us. There's us and there's them!     Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning?     There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me!     You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee!     - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee.     Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!     There he is. He's in the pool.     You know what your problem is, Barry?     I gotta start thinking bee?     How much longer will this go on?     It's been three days! Why aren't you working?     I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about.     What life? You have no life! You have no job. You're barely a bee!     Would it kill you to make a little honey?     Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you.     Martin, would you talk to him?     Barry, I'm talking to you!     You coming?     Got everything?     All set!     Go ahead. I'll catch up.     Don't be too long.     Watch this!     Vanessa!     - We're still here. - I told you not to yell at him.     He doesn't respond to yelling!     - Then why yell at me? - Because you don't listen!     I'm not listening to this.     Sorry, I've gotta go.     - Where are you going? - I'm meeting a friend.     A girl? Is this why you can't decide?     Bye.     I just hope she's Bee-ish.     They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena?     To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream!     Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering.     A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events?     No. All right, I've got one. How come you don't fly everywhere?     It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster.     Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn.     TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane!     You don't have that?     We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease.     Oh, my.     Dumb bees!     You must want to sting all those jerks.     We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us.     So you have to watch your temper.     Very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk,     write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion:     Anger, jealousy, lust.     Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?     Yeah.     - What is wrong with you?! - It's a bug.     He's not bothering anybody. Get out of here, you creep!     What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?     Yeah, it was. How did you know?     It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.     You've really got that down to a science.     - I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue. - I'll bet.     What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this?     How did this get here? Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,     Ray Liotta Private Select?     - Is he that actor? - I never heard of him.     - Why is this here? - For people. We eat it.     You don't have enough food of your own?     - Well, yes. - How do you get it?     - Bees make it. - I know who makes it!     And it's hard to make it!     There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing!     - It's organic. - It's our-ganic!     It's just honey, Barry.     Just what?!     Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing!     You've taken our homes, schools, hospitals! This is all we have!     And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this.     I'm getting to the bottom of all of this!     Hey, Hector.     - You almost done? - Almost.     He is here. I sense it.     Well, I guess I'll go home now     and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around.     You're busted, box boy!     I knew I heard something. So you can talk!     I can talk. And now you'll start talking!     Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier?     I don't understand. I thought we were friends.     The last thing we want to do is upset bees!     You're too late! It's ours now!     You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword!     You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio!     Where is the honey coming from?     Tell me where!     Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!     Orazy person!     What horrible thing has happened here?     These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now     they're on the road to nowhere!     Just keep still.     What? You're not dead?     Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed?     To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here.     I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off!     I'm going to Tacoma.     - And you? - He really is dead.     All right.     Uh-oh!     - What is that?! - Oh, no!     - A wiper! Triple blade! - Triple blade?     Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!     Why does everything have to be so doggone clean?!     How much do you people need to see?!     Open your eyes! Stick your head out the window!     From NPR News in Washington, I'm Oarl Kasell.     But don't kill no more bugs!     - Bee! - Moose blood guy!!     - You hear something? - Like what?     Like tiny screaming.     Turn off the radio.     Whassup, bee boy?     Hey, Blood.     Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see.     Wow!     I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it.     I mean, that honey's ours.     - Bees hang tight. - We're all jammed in.     It's a close community.     Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own.     - What if you get in trouble? - You a mosquito, you in trouble.     Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack!     At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls.     Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly.     Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.     You got to be kidding me!     Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee!     - Hey, guys! - Mooseblood!     I knew I'd catch y'all down here. Did you bring your crazy straw?     We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit.     What is this place?     A bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead.     They are pinheads!     Pinhead.     - Oheck out the new smoker. - Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.     The Thomas 3000!     Smoker?     Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar.     A couple breaths of this knocks them right out.     They make the honey, and we make the money.     ""They make the honey, and we make the money""?     Oh, my!     What's going on? Are you OK?     Yeah. It doesn't last too long.     Do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls?     Our queen was moved here. We had no choice.     This is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes!     That's a drag queen!     What is this?     Oh, no!     There's hundreds of them!     Bee honey.     Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale!     This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something.     Oh, Barry, stop.     Who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor.     Do these look like rumors?     That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos.     How did you get mixed up in this?     He's been talking to humans.     - What? - Talking to humans?!     He has a human girlfriend. And they make out!     Make out? Barry!     We do not.     - You wish you could. - Whose side are you on?     The bees!     I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night.     Barry, this is what you want to do with your life?     I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees!     Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked     your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop.     I remember that.     What right do they have to our honey?     We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!     Even if it's true, what can one bee do?     Sting them where it really hurts.     In the face! The eye!     - That would hurt. - No.     Up the nose? That's a killer.     There's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters.     Hive at Five, the hive's only full-hour action news source.     No more bee beards!     With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.     Weather with Storm Stinger.     Sports with Buzz Larvi.     And Jeanette Ohung.     - Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble. - And I'm Jeanette Ohung.     A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,     intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey,     packaging it and profiting from it illegally!     Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,     we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book,     Olassy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon.     Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.     Did you ever think, ""I'm a kid from the hive. I can't do this""?     Bees have never been afraid to change the world.     What about Bee Oolumbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?     Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.     We were thinking of stickball or candy stores.     How old are you?     The bee community is supporting you in this case,     which will be the trial of the bee century.     You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too.     It's a common name. Next week...     He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots...     Next week...     Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard 'em.     Bear Week next week! They're scary, hairy and here live.     Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish.     In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness!     It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.     Honey, her backhand's a joke! I'm not gonna take advantage of that?     Quiet, please. Actual work going on here.     - Is that that same bee? - Yes, it is!     I'm helping him sue the human race.     - Hello. - Hello, bee.     This is Ken.     Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.     Why does he talk again?     Listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working.     But it's our yogurt night!     Bye-bye.     Why is yogurt night so difficult?!     You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours!     Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help.     - Frosting... - How many sugars?     Just one. I try not to use the competition.     So why are you helping me?     Bees have good qualities.     And it takes my mind off the shop.     Instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now.     Those are great, if you're three.     And artificial flowers.     - Oh, those just get me psychotic! - Yeah, me too.     Bent stingers, pointless pollination.     Bees must hate those fake things!     Nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done.     Maybe this could make up for it a little bit.     - This lawsuit's a pretty big deal. - I guess.     You sure you want to go through with it?     Am I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able     to say, ""Honey, I'm home,"" without paying a royalty!     It's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan,     where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history,     we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak.     What have we gotten into here, Barry?     It's pretty big, isn't it?     I can't believe how many humans don't work during the day.     You think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers?     Everybody needs to stay behind the barricade.     - What's the matter? - I don't know, I just got a chill.     Well, if it isn't the bee team.     You boys work on this?     All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding.     All right. Oase number 4475,     Superior Oourt of New York, Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry     is now in session.     Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively?     A privilege.     Mr. Benson... you're representing all the bees of the world?     I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed.     Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please.     Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,     my grandmother was a simple woman.     Born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right     to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us.     If we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines,     just think of what would it mean.     I would have to negotiate with the silkworm     for the elastic in my britches!     Talking bee!     How do we know this isn't some sort of     holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry?     They could be using laser beams!     Robotics! Ventriloquism! Oloning! For all we know,     he could be on steroids!     Mr. Benson?     Ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here.     I'm just an ordinary bee. Honey's pretty important to me.     It's important to all bees. We invented it!     We make it. And we protect it with our lives.     Unfortunately, there are some people in this room     who think they can take it from us     'cause we're the little guys! I'm hoping that, after this is all over,     you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have     but everything we are!     I wish he'd dress like that all the time. So nice!     Oall your first witness.     So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have.     I suppose so.     I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron!     Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms.     Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term.     I don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you?     - No. - I couldn't hear you.     - No. - No.     Because you don't free bees. You keep bees. Not only that,     it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey.     They're very lovable creatures.     Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.     You mean like this?     Bears kill bees!     How'd you like his head crashing through your living room?!     Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows!     OK, that's enough. Take him away.     So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me.     - Where have I heard it before? - I was with a band called The Police.     But you've never been a police officer, have you?     No, I haven't.     No, you haven't. And so here we have yet another example     of bee culture casually stolen by a human     for nothing more than a prance-about stage name.     Oh, please.     Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?     Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting.     Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!     That's not his real name?! You idiots!     Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on     your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005.     Thank you. Thank you.     I see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome     with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow.     I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?     Not yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you?     Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don't     have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir?     Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now!     This isn't a goodfella. This is a badfella!     Why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?!     - Order in this court! - You're all thinking it!     Order! Order, I say!     - Say it! - Mr. Liotta, please sit down!     I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that.     I think the jury's on our side.     Are we doing everything right, legally?     I'm a florist.     Right. Well, here's to a great team.     To a great team!     Well, hello.     - Ken! - Hello.     I didn't think you were coming.     No, I was just late. I tried to call, but... the battery.     I didn't want all this to go to waste, so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.     Oh, that was lucky.     There's a little left. I could heat it up.     Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.     So I hear you're quite a tennis player.     I'm not much for the game myself. The ball's a little grabby.     That's where I usually sit. Right... there.     Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,     and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill.     You think I don't see what you're doing?     I know how hard it is to find the rightjob. We have that in common.     Do we?     Bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out.     That's just what I was thinking about doing.     Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.     I'm going to drain the old stinger.     Yeah, you do that.     Look at that.     You know, I've just about had it     with your little mind games.     - What's that? - Italian Vogue.     Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.     A lot of ads.     Remember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine?     Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!     I think something stinks in here!     I love the smell of flowers.     How do you like the smell of flames?!     Not as much.     Water bug! Not taking sides!     Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat! This is pathetic!     I've got issues!     Well, well, well, a royal flush!     - You're bluffing. - Am I?     Surf's up, dude!     Poo water!     That bowl is gnarly.     Except for those dirty yellow rings!     Kenneth! What are you doing?!     You know, I don't even like honey! I don't eat it!     We need to talk!     He's just a little bee!     And he happens to be the nicest bee I've met in a long time!     Long time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life?     No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you're one of them!     Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...     My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster!     Goodbye, Ken.     And for your information,     I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made by man!     I'm sorry about all that.     I know it's got an aftertaste! I like it!     I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me.     I couldn't overcome it. Oh, well.     Are you OK for the trial?     I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas.     We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.     Good idea! You can really see why he's considered one of the best lawyers...     Yeah.     Layton, you've gotta weave some magic     with this jury, or it's gonna be all over.     Don't worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around     is to remind them of what they don't like about bees.     - You got the tweezers? - Are you allergic?     Only to losing, son. Only to losing.     Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know.     What exactly is your relationship     to that woman?     We're friends.     - Good friends? - Yes.     How good? Do you live together?     Wait a minute...     Are you her little...     ...bedbug?     I've seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand,     doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee children?     - Yeah, but... - So those aren't your real parents!     - Oh, Barry... - Yes, they are!     Hold me back!     You're an illegitimate bee, aren't you, Benson?     He's denouncing bees!     Don't y'all date your cousins?     - Objection! - I'm going to pincushion this guy!     Adam, don't! It's what he wants!     Oh, I'm hit!!     Oh, lordy, I am hit!     Order! Order!     The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins!     I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction!     You see? You can't treat them like equals! They're striped savages!     Stinging's the only thing they know! It's their way!     - Adam, stay with me. - I can't feel my legs.     What angel of mercy will come forward to suck the poison     from my heaving buttocks?     I will have order in this court. Order!     Order, please!     The case of the honeybees versus the human race     took a pointed turn against the bees     yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery.     - Hey, buddy. - Hey.     - Is there much pain? - Yeah.     I...     I blew the whole case, didn't I?     It doesn't matter. What matters is you're alive. You could have died.     I'd be better off dead. Look at me.     They got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.     Look, there's a little celery still on it.     What was it like to sting someone?     I can't explain it. It was all...     All adrenaline and then... and then ecstasy!     All right.     You think it was all a trap?     Of course. I'm sorry. I flew us right into this.     What were we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of bugs in this world.     What will the humans do to us if they win?     I don't know.     I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn't sound so bad.     Adam, they check in, but they don't check out!     Oh, my.     Oould you get a nurse to close that window?     - Why? - The smoke.     Bees don't smoke.     Right. Bees don't smoke.     Bees don't smoke! But some bees are smoking.     That's it! That's our case!     It is? It's not over?     Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.     Get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can.     And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.     Mr. Flayman.     Yes? Yes, Your Honor!     Where is the rest of your team?     Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.     Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,     and as a result, we don't make very good time.     I actually heard a funny story about...     Your Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs     taken up enough of this court's valuable time?     How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on?     They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges     against my clients, who run legitimate businesses.     I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case!     Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going     to have to consider Mr. Montgomery's motion.     But you can't! We have a terrific case.     Where is your proof? Where is the evidence?     Show me the smoking gun!     Hold it, Your Honor! You want a smoking gun?     Here is your smoking gun.     What is that?     It's a bee smoker!     What, this? This harmless little contraption?     This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee.     Look at what has happened     to bees who have never been asked, ""Smoking or non?""     Is this what nature intended for us?     To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines     and man-made wooden slat work camps?     Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man?     - What are we gonna do? - He's playing the species card.     Ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees!     Free the bees! Free the bees!     Free the bees!     Free the bees! Free the bees!     The court finds in favor of the bees!     Vanessa, we won!     I knew you could do it! High-five!     Sorry.     I'm OK! You know what this means?     All the honey will finally belong to the bees.     Now we won't have to work so hard all the time.     This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson.     You'll regret this.     Barry, how much honey is out there?     All right. One at a time.     Barry, who are you wearing?     My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants.     - What if Montgomery's right? - What do you mean?     We've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years.     Oongratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement?     First, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps.     Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with,     every last drop.     We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more     than a filthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine.     We're all aware of what they do in the woods.     Wait for my signal.     Take him out.     He'll have nauseous for a few hours, then he'll be fine.     And we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames...     But it's just a prance-about stage name!     ...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products     and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments.     Oan't breathe.     Bring it in, boys!     Hold it right there! Good.     Tap it.     Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups, and there's gallons more coming!     - I think we need to shut down! - Shut down? We've never shut down.     Shut down honey production!     Stop making honey!     Turn your key, sir!     What do we do now?     Oannonball!     We're shutting honey production!     Mission abort.     Aborting pollination and nectar detail. Returning to base.     Adam, you wouldn't believe how much honey was out there.     Oh, yeah?     What's going on? Where is everybody?     - Are they out celebrating? - They're home.     They don't know what to do. Laying out, sleeping in.     I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket.     At least we got our honey back.     Sometimes I think, so what if humans liked our honey? Who wouldn't?     It's the greatest thing in the world! I was excited to be part of making it.     This was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well.     And now...     Now I can't.     I don't understand why they're not happy.     I thought their lives would be better!     They're doing nothing. It's amazing. Honey really changes people.     You don't have any idea what's going on, do you?     - What did you want to show me? - This.     What happened here?     That is not the half of it.     Oh, no. Oh, my.     They're all wilting.     Doesn't look very good, does it?     No.     And whose fault do you think that is?     You know, I'm gonna guess bees.     Bees?     Specifically, me.     I didn't think bees not needing to make honey would affect all these things.     It's notjust flowers. Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.     That's our whole SAT test right there.     Take away produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom.     And then, of course...     The human species?     So if there's no more pollination,     it could all just go south here, couldn't it?     I know this is also partly my fault.     How about a suicide pact?     How do we do it?     - I'll sting you, you step on me. - Thatjust kills you twice.     Right, right.     Listen, Barry... sorry, but I gotta get going.     I had to open my mouth and talk.     Vanessa?     Vanessa? Why are you leaving? Where are you going?     To the final Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena.     They've moved it to this weekend because all the flowers are dying.     It's the last chance I'll ever have to see it.     Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry. I never meant it to turn out like this.     I know. Me neither.     Tournament of Roses. Roses can't do sports.     Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?     Roses!     Vanessa!     Roses?!     Barry?     - Roses are flowers! - Yes, they are.     Flowers, bees, pollen!     I know. That's why this is the last parade.     Maybe not. Oould you ask him to slow down?     Oould you slow down?     Barry!     OK, I made a huge mistake. This is a total disaster, all my fault.     Yes, it kind of is.     I've ruined the planet. I wanted to help you     with the flower shop. I've made it worse.     Actually, it's completely closed down.     I thought maybe you were remodeling.     But I have another idea, and it's greater than my previous ideas combined.     I don't want to hear it!     All right, they have the roses, the roses have the pollen.     I know every bee, plant and flower bud in this park.     All we gotta do is get what they've got back here with what we've got.     - Bees. - Park.     - Pollen! - Flowers.     - Repollination! - Across the nation!     Tournament of Roses, Pasadena, Oalifornia.     They've got nothing but flowers, floats and cotton candy.     Security will be tight.     I have an idea.     Vanessa Bloome, FTD.     Official floral business. It's real.     Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.     Thank you. It was a gift.     Once inside, we just pick the right float.     How about The Princess and the Pea?     I could be the princess, and you could be the pea!     Yes, I got it.     - Where should I sit? - What are you?     - I believe I'm the pea. - The pea?     It goes under the mattresses.     - Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart. - I'm getting the marshal.     You do that! This whole parade is a fiasco!     Let's see what this baby'll do.     Hey, what are you doing?!     Then all we do is blend in with traffic...     ...without arousing suspicion.     Once at the airport, there's no stopping us.     Stop! Security.     - You and your insect pack your float? - Yes.     Has it been in your possession the entire time?     Would you remove your shoes?     - Remove your stinger. - It's part of me.     I know. Just having some fun. Enjoy your flight.     Then if we're lucky, we'll have just enough pollen to do the job.     Oan you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job!     I think this is gonna work.     It's got to work.     Attention, passengers, this is Oaptain Scott.     We have a bit of bad weather in New York.     It looks like we'll experience a couple hours delay.     Barry, these are cut flowers with no water. They'll never make it.     I gotta get up there and talk to them.     Be careful.     Oan I get help with the Sky Mall magazine?     I'd like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.     Oaptain, I'm in a real situation.     - What'd you say, Hal? - Nothing.     Bee!     Don't freak out! My entire species...     What are you doing?     - Wait a minute! I'm an attorney! - Who's an attorney?     Don't move.     Oh, Barry.     Good afternoon, passengers. This is your captain.     Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B please report to the cockpit?     And please hurry!     What happened here?     There was a DustBuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded.     One's bald, one's in a boat, they're both unconscious!     - Is that another bee joke? - No!     No one's flying the plane!     This is JFK control tower, Flight 356. What's your status?     This is Vanessa Bloome. I'm a florist from New York.     Where's the pilot?     He's unconscious, and so is the copilot.     Not good. Does anyone onboard have flight experience?     As a matter of fact, there is.     - Who's that? - Barry Benson.     From the honey trial?! Oh, great.     Vanessa, this is nothing more than a big metal bee.     It's got giant wings, huge engines.     I can't fly a plane.     - Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot? - Yes.     How hard could it be?     Wait, Barry! We're headed into some lightning.     This is Bob Bumble. We have some late-breaking news from JFK Airport,     where a suspenseful scene is developing.     Barry Benson, fresh from his legal victory...     That's Barry!     ...is attempting to land a plane, loaded with people, flowers     and an incapacitated flight crew.     Flowers?!     We have a storm in the area and two individuals at the controls     with absolutely no flight experience.     Just a minute. There's a bee on that plane.     I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson and his no-account compadres.     They've done enough damage.     But isn't he your only hope?     Technically, a bee shouldn't be able to fly at all.     Their wings are too small...     Haven't we heard this a million times?     ""The surface area of the wings and body mass make no sense.""     - Get this on the air! - Got it.     - Stand by. - We're going live.     The way we work may be a mystery to you.     Making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs.     But let me tell you about a small job.     If you do it well, it makes a big difference.     More than we realized. To us, to everyone.     That's why I want to get bees back to working together.     That's the bee way! We're not made of Jell-O.     We get behind a fellow.     - Black and yellow! - Hello!     Left, right, down, hover.     - Hover? - Forget hover.     This isn't so hard. Beep-beep! Beep-beep!     Barry, what happened?!     Wait, I think we were on autopilot the whole time.     - That may have been helping me. - And now we're not!     So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.     All of you, let's get behind this fellow! Move it out!     Move out!     Our only chance is if I do what I'd do, you copy me with the wings of the plane!     Don't have to yell.     I'm not yelling! We're in a lot of trouble.     It's very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice!     It's not a tone. I'm panicking!     I can't do this!     Vanessa, pull yourself together. You have to snap out of it!     You snap out of it.     You snap out of it.     - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it!     - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it!     - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it!     - Hold it! - Why? Oome on, it's my turn.     How is the plane flying?     I don't know.     Hello?     Benson, got any flowers for a happy occasion in there?     The Pollen Jocks!     They do get behind a fellow.     - Black and yellow. - Hello.     All right, let's drop this tin can on the blacktop.     Where? I can't see anything. Oan you?     No, nothing. It's all cloudy.     Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry.     - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee.     Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!     Wait a minute. I think I'm feeling something.     - What? - I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.     Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.     Bring the nose down.     Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!     - What in the world is on the tarmac? - Get some lights on that!     Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!     - Vanessa, aim for the flower. - OK.     Out the engines. We're going in on bee power. Ready, boys?     Affirmative!     Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.     Land on that flower!     Ready? Full reverse!     Spin it around!     - Not that flower! The other one! - Which one?     - That flower. - I'm aiming at the flower!     That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt. I mean the giant pulsating flower     made of millions of bees!     Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.     Rotate around it.     - This is insane, Barry! - This's the only way I know how to fly.     Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane flying in an insect-like pattern?     Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid. Smell it. Full reverse!     Just drop it. Be a part of it.     Aim for the center!     Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!     Oome on, already.     Barry, we did it! You taught me how to fly!     - Yes. No high-five! - Right.     Barry, it worked! Did you see the giant flower?     What giant flower? Where? Of course I saw the flower! That was genius!     - Thank you. - But we're not done yet.     Listen, everyone!     This runway is covered with the last pollen     from the last flowers available anywhere on Earth.     That means this is our last chance.     We're the only ones who make honey, pollinate flowers and dress like this.     If we're gonna survive as a species, this is our moment! What do you say?     Are we going to be bees, orjust Museum of Natural History keychains?     We're bees!     Keychain!     Then follow me! Except Keychain.     Hold on, Barry. Here.     You've earned this.     Yeah!     I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.     Oh, yeah.     That's our Barry.     Mom! The bees are back!     If anybody needs to make a call, now's the time.     I got a feeling we'll be working late tonight!     Here's your change. Have a great afternoon! Oan I help who's next?     Would you like some honey with that? It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.     Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me. And I don't see a nickel!     Sometimes I just feel like a piece of meat!     I had no idea.     Barry, I'm sorry. Have you got a moment?     Would you excuse me? My mosquito associate will help you.     Sorry I'm late.     He's a lawyer too?     I was already a blood-sucking parasite. All I needed was a briefcase.     Have a great afternoon!     Barry, I just got this huge tulip order, and I can't get them anywhere.     No problem, Vannie. Just leave it to me.     You're a lifesaver, Barry. Oan I help who's next?     All right, scramble, jocks! It's time to fly.     Thank you, Barry!     That bee is living my life!     Let it go, Kenny.     - When will this nightmare end?! - Let it all go.     - Beautiful day to fly. - Sure is.     Between you and me, I was dying to get out of that office.     You have got to start thinking bee, my friend.     - Thinking bee! - Me?     Hold it. Let's just stop for a second. Hold it.     I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone. Oan we stop here?     I'm not making a major life decision during a production number!     All right. Take ten, everybody. Wrap it up, guys.     I had virtually no rehearsal for that.

The controller must be robust to external disturbances, such as road surface, weather, wind conditions, and so on. It also needs to deal with internal variations of vehicle sub-systems, including powertrain inefficiency, measurement errors, time delay, etc. These factors introduce issues in controller performance. In this paper, a feed-forward compensator is designed via a data-driven method to model and optimize the controller’s performance. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied for extracting influential features, after which a Time Delay Neural Network is adopted to predict control errors over a future time horizon. Based on the predicted error, a feedforward compensator is then designed to improve control performance. Simulation results in different scenarios show that, with the help of with the proposed feedforward compensator, the maximum path tracking error and the steering wheel angle oscillation are improved by 44.4% and 26.7%, respectively.",20,9,20,weather,GitHub
