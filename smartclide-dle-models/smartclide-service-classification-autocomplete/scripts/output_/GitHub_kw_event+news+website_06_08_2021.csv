It provides the facility to the students or guest to have complete information about the institute. In this website, does not need to perform papers work likes to make result sheet on papers and then put on the notice board. But on this site just go to the database and update the result and other information. “Institute of Current Students” is a web enabled project with client server application. This website is an initiative to take all the academic and administrative processes of the Institute for IT backbone. This Project is purely web-based that can be accessed from any part of the world with the help of any standard web browser and a working internet connection. “Institute of Current Students” is an automation system which is used to store the information of Institute, faculty, student, exams, and results in the Institute database. Starting from registration of a new student in the institute, it maintains all the details regarding the details about the student and marks of the students. We can also call institute as “Institute Information Centre”. Institute Information Centre provides a solution of all problems in the form of easy to configure and use application by automating all the functionality. To make this website work successfully I shall be using some latest technology such as BOOTSTRAP FRAMEWORK for designing, PHP as the Development Platform and MYSQL as the Database Management environment.",11,9,11,event+news+website+php+php7+php-library+php-framework+html+html5+css+css-framework+css3+bootstrap4+bootstrap+font-awesome+js+javascript+htaccess+htaccess-snippets+projects+academic+academic-website+bca,GitHub

McCorduck 2004, pp. 100–101, who writes that there are ""two major branches of artificial intelligence: one aimed at producing intelligent behavior regardless of how it was accomplished, and the other aimed at modeling intelligent processes found in nature, particularly human ones."" Kolata 1982, a paper in Science, which describes McCarthy's indifference to biological models. Kolata quotes McCarthy as writing: ""This is AI, so we don't care if it's psychologically real"".[19] McCarthy recently reiterated his position at the AI@50 conference where he said ""Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence"".[20].

She writes: ""I like to think of artificial intelligence as the scientific apotheosis of a venerable cultural tradition.""[26] ""Artificial intelligence in one form or another is an idea that has pervaded Western intellectual history, a dream in urgent need of being realized.""[27] ""Our history is full of attempts—nutty, eerie, comical, earnest, legendary and real—to make artificial intelligences, to reproduce what is the essential us—bypassing the ordinary means. Back and forth between myth and reality, our imaginations supplying what our workshops couldn't, we have engaged for a long time in this odd form of self-reproduction.""[28] She traces the desire back to its Hellenistic roots and calls it the urge to ""forge the Gods.""[29]  ""Stephen Hawking believes AI could be mankind's last accomplishment"".

22,Infosequare,https://github.com/lalitvchau/Infosequare.git,"News is information about current events. Journalists provide news through many different media, based on word of mouth, printing, postal systems, broadcasting, and electronic communication.  Common topics for news reports include war, government, politics, education, health, the environment, economy, business, and entertainment, as well as athletic events, quirky or unusual events. Government proclamations, concerning royal ceremonies, laws, taxes, public health, criminals, have been dubbed news since ancient times.  Humans exhibit a nearly universal desire to learn and share news, which they satisfy by talking to each other and sharing information. Technological and social developments, often driven by government communication and espionage networks, have increased the speed with which news can spread, as well as influenced its content. The genre of news as we know it today is closely associated with the newspaper, which originated in China as a court bulletin and spread, with paper and printing press, to Europe.  Online journalism is news that is reported on the Internet. News can be delivered more quickly through this method of news as well as accessed more easily. The internet era has transformed the understanding of news. Because the internet allows communication which is not only instantaneous, but also multi-directional, it has blurred the boundaries of who is a legitimate news producer. In this project we are trying to implement the news website in such a way that it should provide useful information as well as the associated videos from all possible areas like entertainment, politics, scientific, war, sports, education etc.The main aim of this project is to store and maintain all the information(soft-copy) from older days till the current situations.

79,How-to-Understand-Web-Architecture-,https://github.com/softram135/How-to-Understand-Web-Architecture-.git,"We improve plan when we comprehend our medium. However even at this late social hour, numerous individuals don't comprehend website composition. Among them can be discovered a portion of our most recognised business and social pioneers, including a rare sorts of people who have a significant handle of configuration—besides as it identifies with the web.   Some who don't comprehend website architecture all things considered have the work of making sites or administering website specialists and engineers. Other people who don't comprehend website composition are in any case expertly accused of assessing it for the benefit of most of us. The individuals who comprehend the least make the calmer. They are the ones driving charges, pummelling entryways, and tossing cash—at all some unacceptable individuals and things.    In the event that we need better locales, better work, and better-educated customers, the need to instruct starts with us.   Favouring land to Website  It's difficult to comprehend website architecture when you don't comprehend the web. What's more, it's difficult to comprehend the web when the individuals who are paid to clarify it either don't get it themselves, or are obliged for business motivations to stifle some of what they know, underscoring the over the splendid.  The news media time after time fails to understand the situation. A lot of web reporting follows the cash; too little covers craftsmanship and thoughts. Driven by editors compelled by distributers stressed over evaporating sponsors, even columnists who comprehend the web invest the vast majority of their energy expounding on arrangements and citing deal makers.  It isn't so much that business isn't a few columnists' beat. In any case, zeroing in on business to the rejection of all else resembles giving an account of land bargains while overlooking design.  At the point when silly expectations bite the dust ludicrous no one leaves the newsroom, they simply toss another line into the water—like advertisers supplanting a motto that failed. Following quite a while of information commoditization, what's astounding is the number of good journalists there still are, and how diligently many attempt to lay exact data before general society. In some cases you can nearly hear it underneath the thunder of the bizarre and the outstanding.  THE SUSTAINABLE CIRCLE OF SELF-REGARD  News media are not by any means the only ones missing the point. Proficient affiliations miss the point each day, and celebrate their misleading quality with a yearly celebration. Every year, promoting and plan magazines and expert associations hold challenges for “new media configuration” decided by the champs of a year ago are rivalries. That they call it ""new media configuration"" reveals to them nothing and you and me everything.  Despite the fact that there are exemptions, generally the makers of winning passages consider the  to be as a vehicle for publicising and advertising efforts in which the client inactively encounters Flash and video content. For the dynamic client, there is gaming—yet what you and I consider as dynamic web use is restricted to clicking a ""Digg this page"" button.  The triumphant locales look spectacular as screen shots in reflexive plan annuals. At the point when the victors become judges, they reward work like their own. In this manner locales that carry on like TV and look great between covers keep on being made, and an age of customers and craftsmanship chiefs believes that stuff is the cream of website architecture.  Plan CRITICS GET IT WRONG, TOO  Individuals who are brilliant about print can be less splendid about the web. Their basic resources, sharpened flawlessly during the Kerning Wars, crush to bits against the blockades of our calling.  The less complex regret for our benefit that we are left with monstrous textual styles. They wonder resoundingly how we can appreciate functioning in a medium that offers us not exactly outright command over each iota of the visual experience. What they are subtly finding out if we are genuine architects. (They speculate that we are not.) But these are the youngsters, the plan understudies and future pundits. Their sentiments are primarily important to their educators, and one implores they have great ones.  Typography, engineering, and website composition  The difficulty is, website composition, despite the fact that it utilizes components of visual computerization and outline, doesn't guide to them. On the off chance that one should contrast the web with other media, typography would be a superior decision. For a website composition, similar to a typeface, is a climate for another person's demeanour. Stick around and I'll disclose to you which site configuration resembles.  Engineering (the sort that utilisation steel and glass and stone) is additionally an able examination—or possibly, more adept than banner plan. The engineer makes planes and frameworks that encourage the powerful conduct of individuals. Having planned, the designer gives up control. Over the long run, individuals who utilise the structure bring out and add to the significance of the engineer's plan.  Obviously, all examinations are amazing naturally. What is the ""London Calling"" of TV? Who is the Jane Austen of car plan? Madame Butterfly isn't less lovely for having no vehicle pursue arrangement, peanut butter no less scrumptious in light of the fact that it can't move.  SO WHAT IS WEB DESIGN?  Website architecture isn't book plan, it isn't banner plan, it isn't delineation, and the most elevated accomplishments of those orders are not what website composition focuses on. Despite the fact that sites can be conveyance frameworks for games and recordings, and albeit those conveyance frameworks can be beautiful to take a gander at, such destinations are models of game plan and video narrating, not of website architecture. So what is website architecture?  Website architecture is the production of computerised conditions that encourage a lot human action; reflect or adjust to singular voices and substance; and change effortlessly over the long haul while continually holding their character.  Extraordinary website compositions resemble incredible structures. All places of business, anyway particular, have anterooms and restrooms and flights of stairs. Sites, as well, share shared characteristics.  Albeit an extraordinary site configuration is totally singular, it is additionally an incredible arrangement like other site plans that perform comparative capacities. The equivalent is valid for incredible magazine and paper formats, which vary from commonplace magazine and paper designs in a hundred unpretentious subtleties. Few praise incredible magazine designs, yet millions intentionally or unwittingly appreciate them, and no one regrets that they are not banners.  The unpractised or efficiently insightful creator grumbles that such a large number of sites use networks, an excessive number of locales use segments, and such a large number of destinations are ""square shaped."" Efforts to evade have been around since 1995; while incidentally effective, they have frequently delivered tastefully pathetic and unnecessarily unusable plans.

80,Apple-privacy-policy-frustrates-government,https://github.com/jamesrain/Apple-privacy-policy-frustrates-government.git,"The release of the Apple iOS 8 software meant that Apple updated its privacy policy. As a company that has always put personal privacy above all else, this means you can expect your personal information to be even more protected than before. But to what extent should you expect privacy, and at what point is the government going to step in and say no?  What privacy can you expect?  You might be wondering if the Apple privacy policy means you can avoid all government spying. Of course, that would be impossible. As Fox News explains, Apple can only control the information associated with its phones and Apple accounts. All other information is controlled elsewhere. For example, a phone tap could still happen because Apple does not provide the cell service, just the device. And spying through social media is still possible. The only things covered in the Apple privacy policy is anything associated with your Apple account, such as uploads to your cloud, photo storage, email, contacts, and even call history.  More or less, Apple has explained that it cannot access the data simply because it has created a privacy system where it cannot bypass your passcode. If a warrant is placed for access to account information, Apple can deny it because it has no way to access the info. For cops, this means they don’t have access even if they get judge authority. For you, it means your information is protected in all circumstances.  Government action?  It is possible the government could come in and say that Apple has to retain access to accounts in the event of a national crisis or threat to the nation; however, that has not yet happened. For now, Apple intends to provide as much privacy as possible to its customers, so they feel comfortable using their personal devices without fear of information leaking.  Some people are hesitant to trust Apple after the incident of leaked nude celebrity photos from the iCloud, but Apple says those were isolated incidents where hackers stole passcode data to get the images rather than the photos just getting leaked.  Privacy important to customers  As you are working on your automated text systems and allowing your customers to text you for an automated response, it is important that you keep their information private as well. There is nothing that will make a customer leave faster than finding out you just sold their personal information to another company. Make sure you have a privacy policy on your texting services clearly laid out when your customers sign up and again on your website to prevent confusion.
