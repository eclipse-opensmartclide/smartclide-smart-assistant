Start Download In computing, databases are sometimes classified according to their organizational approach. The most prevalent approach is the relational database, a tabular database in which data is defined so that it can be reorganized and accessed in a number of different ways. A distributed database is one that can be dispersed or replicated among different points in a network. An object-oriented programming database is one that is congruent with the data defined in object classes and subclasses.  Computer databases typically contain aggregations of data records or files, such as sales transactions, product catalogs and inventories, and customer profiles. Typically, a database manager provides users the capabilities of controlling read/write access, specifying report generation, and analyzing usage. Databases and database managers are prevalent in large mainframe systems, but are also present in smaller distributed workstation and mid-range systems such as the AS/400 and on personal computers.

We track the tremendous work done across the Consortium through homogeneous work-spaces in Github which enables better monitoring and management.  We are in the middle of a period where we are chartering numerous working groups which demonstrate the rapid degree of change for the Web platform:  After 4 years, we are nearly ready to publish a Payment Request API Proposed Recommendation and we need to soon charter follow-on work. In the last year we chartered the Web Payment Security Interest Group. In the last year we chartered the Web Media Working Group with 7 specifications for next generation Media support on the Web. We have Accessibility Guidelines under W3C Member review which includes Silver, a new approach. We have just launched the Decentralized Identifier Working Group which has tremendous potential because Decentralized Identifier (DID) is an identifier that is globally unique, resolveable with high availability, and cryptographically verifiable. We have Privacy IG (PING) under W3C Member review which strengthens our focus on the tradeoff between privacy and function. We have a new CSS charter under W3C Member review which maps the group's work for the next three years. In this period, W3C and the WHATWG have succesfully completed the negotiation of a Memorandum of Understanding rooted in the mutual belief that that having two distinct specifications claiming to be normative is generally harmful for the Web community. The MOU, signed last May, describes how the two organizations are to collaborate on the development of a single authoritative version of the HTML and DOM specifications. W3C subsequently rechartered the HTML Working Group to assist the W3C community in raising issues and proposing solutions for the HTML and DOM specifications, and for the production of W3C Recommendations from WHATWG Review Drafts.  As the Web evolves continuously, some groups are looking for ways for specifications to do so as well. So-called ""evergreen recommendations"" or ""living standards"" aim to track continuous development (and maintenance) of features, on a feature-by-feature basis, while getting review and patent commitments.  We see the maturation and further development of an incredible number of new technologies coming to the Web. Continued progress in many areas demonstrates the vitality of the W3C and the Web community, as the rest of the report illustrates.  Future Web Standards W3C has a variety of mechanisms for listening to what the community thinks could become good future Web standards. These include discussions with the Membership, discussions with other standards bodies, the activities of thousands of participants in over 300 community groups, and W3C Workshops. There are lots of good ideas. The W3C strategy team has been identifying promising topics and invites public participation.   Future, recent and under consideration Workshops include:  Inclusive XR (5-6 November 2019, Seattle, WA, USA) to explore existing and future approaches on making Virtual and Augmented Reality experiences more inclusive, including to people with disabilities; W3C Workshop on Data Models for Transportation (12-13 September 2019, Palo Alto, CA, USA) W3C Workshop on Web Games (27-28 June 2019, Redmond, WA, USA), view report Second W3C Workshop on the Web of Things (3-5 June 2019, Munich, Germany) W3C Workshop on Web Standardization for Graph Data; Creating Bridges: RDF, Property Graph and SQL (4-6 March 2019, Berlin, Germany), view report Web & Machine Learning. The Strategy Funnel documents the staff's exploration of potential new work at various phases: Exploration and Investigation, Incubation and Evaluation, and eventually to the chartering of a new standards group. The Funnel view is a GitHub Project where new area are issues represented by “cards” which move through the columns, usually from left to right. Most cards start in Exploration and move towards Chartering, or move out of the funnel.  Public input is welcome at any stage but particularly once Incubation has begun. This helps W3C identify work that is sufficiently incubated to warrant standardization, to review the ecosystem around the work and indicate interest in participating in its standardization, and then to draft a charter that reflects an appropriate scope. Ongoing feedback can speed up the overall standardization process.  Since the previous highlights document, W3C has chartered a number of groups, and started discussion on many more:  Newly Chartered or Rechartered  Web Application Security WG (03-Apr) Web Payment Security IG (17-Apr) Patent and Standards IG (24-Apr) Web Applications WG (14-May) Web & Networks IG (16-May) Media WG (23-May) Media and Entertainment IG (06-Jun) HTML WG (06-Jun) Decentralized Identifier WG (05-Sep) Extended  Privacy IG (PING) (30-Sep) Verifiable Claims WG (30-Sep) Service Workers WG (31-Dec) Dataset Exchange WG (31-Dec) Web of Things Working Group (31-Dec) Web Audio Working Group (31-Dec) Proposed charters / Advance Notice  Accessibility Guidelines WG Privacy IG (PING) RDF Literal Direction WG Timed Text WG CSS WG Web Authentication WG Closed  Internationalization Tag Set IG Meeting Industry Needs Web Payments   All Web Payments specifications  W3C's payments standards enable a streamlined checkout experience, enabling a consistent user experience across the Web with lower front end development costs for merchants. Users can store and reuse information and more quickly and accurately complete online transactions.  The Web Payments Working Group has republished Payment Request API as a Candidate Recommendation, aiming to publish a Proposed Recommendation in the Fall 2019, and is discussing use cases and features for Payment Request after publication of the 1.0 Recommendation. Browser vendors have been finalizing implementation of features added in the past year (view the implementation report).  As work continues on the Payment Handler API and its implementation (currently in Chrome and Edge Canary), one focus in 2019 is to increase adoption in other browsers. Recently, Mastercard demonstrated the use of Payment Request API to carry out EMVCo's Secure Remote Commerce (SRC) protocol whose payment method definition is being developed with active participation by Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover. Payment method availability is a key factor in merchant considerations about adopting Payment Request API. The ability to get uniform adoption of a new payment method such as Secure Remote Commerce (SRC) also depends on the availability of the Payment Handler API in browsers, or of proprietary alternatives.  Web Monetization, which the Web Payments Working Group will discuss again at its face-to-face meeting in September, can be used to enable micropayments as an alternative revenue stream to advertising.  Since the beginning of 2019, Amazon, Brave Software, JCB, Certus Cybersecurity Solutions and Netflix have joined the Web Payments Working Group.  In April, W3C launched the Web Payment Security Group to enable W3C, EMVCo, and the FIDO Alliance to collaborate on a vision for Web payment security and interoperability. Participants will define areas of collaboration and identify gaps between existing technical specifications in order to increase compatibility among different technologies, such as:  How do SRC, FIDO, and Payment Request relate? The Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) regulations in Europe are scheduled to take effect in September 2019. What is the role of EMVCo, W3C, and FIDO technologies, and what is the current state of readiness for the deadline? How can we improve privacy on the Web at the same time as we meet industry requirements regarding user identity? Digital Publishing   All Digital Publishing specifications, Publication milestones  The Web is the universal publishing platform. Publishing is increasingly impacted by the Web, and the Web increasingly impacts Publishing.  Topic of particular interest to Publishing@W3C include typography and layout, accessibility, usability, portability, distribution, archiving, offline access, print on demand, and reliable cross referencing. And the diverse publishing community represented in the groups consist of the traditional ""trade"" publishers, ebook reading system manufacturers, but also publishers of audio book, scholarly journals or educational materials, library scientists or browser developers.  The Publishing Working Group currently concentrates on Audiobooks which lack a comprehensive standard, thus incurring extra costs and time to publish in this booming market. Active development is ongoing on the future standard:  Publication Manifest Audiobook profile for Web Publications Lightweight Packaging Format The BD Comics Manga Community Group, the Synchronized Multimedia for Publications Community Group, the Publishing Community Group and a future group on archival, are companions to the working group where specific work is developed and incubated.  The Publishing Community Group is a recently launched incubation channel for Publishing@W3C. The goal of the group is to propose, document, and prototype features broadly related to:  publications on the Web reading modes and systems and the user experience of publications The EPUB 3 Community Group has successfully completed the revision of EPUB 3.2.  The Publishing Business Group fosters ongoing participation by members of the publishing industry and the overall ecosystem in the development of Web infrastructure to better support the needs of the industry. The Business Group serves as an additional conduit to the Publishing Working Group and several Community Groups for feedback between the publishing ecosystem and W3C. The Publishing BG has played a vital role in fostering and advancing the adoption and continued development of EPUB 3. In particular the BG provided critical support to the update of EPUBCheck to validate EPUB content to the new EPUB 3.2 specification. This resulted in the development, in conjunction with the EPUB3 Community Group, of a new generation of EPUBCheck, i.e., EPUBCheck 4.2 production-ready release.  Media and Entertainment   All Media specifications  The Media and Entertainment vertical tracks media-related topics and features that create immersive experiences for end users. HTML5 brought standard audio and video elements to the Web. Standardization activities since then have aimed at turning the Web into a professional platform fully suitable for the delivery of media content and associated materials, enabling missing features to stream video content on the Web such as adaptive streaming and content protection. Together with Microsoft, Comcast, Netflix and Google, W3C received an Technology & Engineering Emmy Award in April 2019 for standardization of a full TV experience on the Web. Current goals are to:  Reinforce core media technologies: Creation of the Media Working Group, to develop media-related specifications incubated in the WICG (e.g. Media Capabilities, Picture-in-picture, Media Session) and maintain maintain/evolve Media Source Extensions (MSE) and Encrypted Media Extensions (EME). Improve support for Media Timed Events: data cues incubation. Enhance color support (HDR, wide gamut), in scope of the CSS WG and in the Color on the Web CG. Reduce fragmentation: Continue annual releases of a common and testable baseline media devices, in scope of the Web Media APIs CG and in collaboration with the CTA WAVE Project. Maintain the Road-map of Media Technologies for the Web which highlights Web technologies that can be used to build media applications and services, as well as known gaps to enable additional use cases. Create the future: Discuss perspectives for Media and Entertainment for the Web. Bring the power of GPUs to the Web (graphics, machine learning, heavy processing), under incubation in the GPU for the Web CG. Transition to a Working Group is under discussion. Determine next steps after the successful W3C Workshop on Web Games of June 2019. View the report. Timed Text  The Timed Text Working Group develops and maintains formats used for the representation of text synchronized with other timed media, like audio and video, and notably works on TTML, profiles of TTML, and WebVTT. Recent progress includes:  A robust WebVTT implementation report poises the specification for publication as a proposed recommendation. Discussions around re-chartering, notably to add a TTML Profile for Audio Description deliverable to the scope of the group, and clarify that rendering of captions within XR content is also in scope. Immersive Web  Hardware that enables Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) applications are now broadly available to consumers, offering an immersive computing platform with both new opportunities and challenges. The ability to interact directly with immersive hardware is critical to ensuring that the web is well equipped to operate as a first-class citizen in this environment.  The Immersive Web Working Group has been stabilizing the WebXR Device API while the companion Immersive Web Community Group incubates the next series of features identified as key for the future of the Immersive Web.  W3C plans a workshop focused on the needs and benefits at the intersection of VR & Accessibility (Inclusive XR), on 5-6 November 2019 in Seattle, WA, USA, to explore existing and future approaches on making Virtual and Augmented Reality experiences more inclusive.  Web & Telecommunications  The Web is the Open Platform for Mobile. Telecommunication service providers and network equipment providers have long been critical actors in the deployment of Web technologies. As the Web platform matures, it brings richer and richer capabilities to extend existing services to new users and devices, and propose new and innovative services.  Real-Time Communications (WebRTC)   All Real-Time Communications specifications  WebRTC has reshaped the whole communication landscape by making any connected device a potential communication end-point, bringing audio and video communications anywhere, on any network, vastly expanding the ability of operators to reach their customers. WebRTC serves as the corner-stone of many online communication and collaboration services.  The WebRTC Working Group aims to bringing WebRTC 1.0 (and companion specification Media Capture and Streams) to Recommendation by the end of 2019. Intense efforts are focused on testing (supported by a dedicated hackathon at IETF 104) and interoperability. The group is considering pushing features that have not gotten enough traction to separate modules or to a later minor revision of the spec.  Beyond WebRTC 1.0, the WebRTC Working Group will focus its efforts on WebRTC NV which the group has started documenting by identifying use cases.  Web & Networks  Recently launched, in the wake of the May 2018 Web5G workshop, the Web & Networks Interest Group is chaired by representatives from AT&T, China Mobile and Intel, with a goal to explore solutions for web applications to achieve better performance and resource allocation, both on the device and network. The group's first efforts are around use cases, privacy & security requirements and liaisons.  Automotive   All Automotive specifications  To create a rich application ecosystem for vehicles and other devices allowed to connect to the vehicle, the W3C Automotive Working Group is delivering a service specification to expose all common vehicle signals (engine temperature, fuel/charge level, range, tire pressure, speed, etc.)  The Vehicle Information Service Specification (VISS), which is a Candidate Recommendation, is seeing more implementations across the industry. It provides the access method to a common data model for all the vehicle signals –presently encapsulating a thousand or so different data elements– and will be growing to accommodate the advances in automotive such as autonomous and driver assist technologies and electrification.  The group is already working on a successor to VISS, leveraging the underlying data model and the VIWI submission from Volkswagen, for a more robust means of accessing vehicle signals information and the same paradigm for other automotive needs including location-based services, media, notifications and caching content.  The Automotive and Web Platform Business Group acts as an incubator for prospective standards work. One of its task forces is using W3C VISS in performing data sampling and off-boarding the information to the cloud. Access to the wealth of information that W3C's auto signals standard exposes is of interest to regulators, urban planners, insurance companies, auto manufacturers, fleet managers and owners, service providers and others. In addition to components needed for data sampling and edge computing, capturing user and owner consent, information collection methods and handling of data are in scope.  The upcoming W3C Workshop on Data Models for Transportation (September 2019) is expected to focus on the need of additional ontologies around transportation space.  Web of Things   All Web of Things specifications  W3C's Web of Things work is designed to bridge disparate technology stacks to allow devices to work together and achieve scale, thus enabling the potential of the Internet of Things by eliminating fragmentation and fostering interoperability.  Thing descriptions expressed in JSON-LD cover the behavior, interaction affordances, data schema, security configuration, and protocol bindings. The Web of Things complements existing IoT ecosystems to reduce the cost and risk for suppliers and consumers of applications that create value by combining multiple devices and information services. There are many sectors that will benefit, e.g. smart homes, smart cities, smart industry, smart agriculture, smart healthcare and many more.  The Web of Things Working Group is finishing the initial Web of Things standards, with support from the Web of Things Interest Group:  Web of Things Architecture Thing Descriptions Strengthening the Core of the Web HTML   The HTML Working Group was chartered early June to assist the W3C community in raising issues and proposing solutions for the HTML and DOM specifications, and to produce W3C Recommendations from WHATWG Review Drafts.  A few days before, W3C and the WHATWG signed a Memorandum of Understanding outlining the agreement to collaborate on the development of a single version of the HTML and DOM specifications.  Issues and proposed solutions for HTML and DOM done via the newly rechartered HTML Working Group in the WHATWG repositories  The HTML Working Group is targetting November 2019 to bring HTML and DOM to Candidate Recommendations.  CSS  All CSS specifications  CSS is a critical part of the Open Web Platform. The CSS Working Group gathers requirements from two large groups of CSS users: the publishing industry and application developers. Within W3C, those groups are exemplified by the Publishing groups and the Web Platform Working Group. The former requires things like better pagination support and advanced font handling, the latter needs intelligent (and fast!) scrolling and animations.  What we know as CSS is actually a collection of almost a hundred specifications, referred to as ‘modules’. The current state of CSS is defined by a snapshot, updated once a year. The group also publishes an index defining every term defined by CSS specifications.  Fonts   All Fonts specifications  The Web Fonts Working Group develops specifications that allow the interoperable deployment of downloadable fonts on the Web, with a focus on Progressive Font Enrichment as well as maintenance of WOFF Recommendations.  Recent and ongoing work includes:  Early API experiments by Adobe and Monotype have demonstrated the feasibility of a font enrichment API, where a server delivers a font with minimal glyph repertoire and the client can query the full repertoire and request additional subsets on-the-fly. In other experiments, the Brotli compression used in WOFF 2 was extended to support shared dictionaries and patch update. Metrics to quantify improvement are a current hot discussion topic. The group will meet at ATypi 2019 in Japan, to gather requirements from the international typography community. The group will first produce a report summarizing the strengths and weaknesses of each prototype solution by Q2 2020. SVG   All SVG specifications  SVG is an important and widely-used part of the Open Web Platform. The SVG Working Group focuses on aligning the SVG 2.0 specification with browser implementations, having split the specification into a currently-implemented 2.0 and a forward-looking 2.1. Current activity is on stabilization, increased integration with the Open Web Platform, and test coverage analysis.  The Working Group was rechartered in March 2019. A new work item concerns native (non-Web-browser) uses of SVG as a non-interactive, vector graphics format.  Audio  The Web Audio Working Group was extended to finish its work on the Web Audio API, expecting to publish it as a Recommendation by year end. The specification enables synthesizing audio in the browser. Audio operations are performed with audio nodes, which are linked together to form a modular audio routing graph. Multiple sources — with different types of channel layout — are supported. This modular design provides the flexibility to create complex audio functions with dynamic effects.  The first version of Web Audio API is now feature complete and is implemented in all modern browsers. Work has started on the next version, and new features are being incubated in the Audio Community Group.  Performance   Web Performance  All Web Performance specifications  There are currently 18 specifications in development in the Web Performance Working Group aiming to provide methods to observe and improve aspects of application performance of user agent features and APIs. The W3C team is looking at related work incubated in the W3C GPU for the Web (WebGPU) Community Group which is poised to transition to a W3C Working Group. A preliminary draft charter is available.  WebAssembly  All WebAssembly specifications  WebAssembly improves Web performance and power by being a virtual machine and execution environment enabling loaded pages to run native (compiled) code. It is deployed in Firefox, Edge, Safari and Chrome. The specification will soon reach Candidate Recommendation.  WebAssembly enables near-native performance, optimized load time, and perhaps most importantly, a compilation target for existing code bases. While it has a small number of native types, much of the performance increase relative to Javascript derives from its use of consistent typing. WebAssembly leverages decades of optimization for compiled languages and the byte code is optimized for compactness and streaming (the web page starts executing while the rest of the code downloads). Network and API access all occurs through accompanying Javascript libraries -- the security model is identical to that of Javascript.  Requirements gathering and language development occur in the Community Group while the Working Group manages test development, community review and progression of specifications on the Recommendation Track.  Testing  Browser testing plays a critical role in the growth of the Web by:  Improving the reliability of Web technology definitions; Improving the quality of implementations of these technologies by helping vendors to detect bugs in their products; Improving the data available to Web developers on known bugs and deficiencies of Web technologies by publishing results of these tests. Browser Testing and Tools  The Browser Testing and Tools Working Group is developing WebDriver version 2, having published last year the W3C Recommendation of WebDriver. WebDriver acts as a remote control interface that enables introspection and control of user agents, provides a platform- and language-neutral wire protocol as a way for out-of-process programs to remotely instruct the behavior of Web, and emulates the actions of a real person using the browser.  WebPlatform Tests   The WebPlatform Tests project now provides a mechanism which allows to fully automate tests that previously needed to be run manually: TestDriver.  TestDriver enables sending trusted key and mouse events, sending complex series of trusted pointer and key interactions for things like in-content drag-and-drop or pinch zoom, and even file upload.  Since 2014 W3C began work on this coordinated open-source effort to build a cross-browser test suite for the Web Platform, which WHATWG, and all major browsers adopted.  Web of Data   All Data specifications  There have been several great success stories around the standardization of data on the web over the past year.  Verifiable Claims seems to have significant uptake. It is also significant that the Distributed Identifier WG charter has received numerous favorable reviews, and was just recently launched. JSON-LD has been a major success with the large deployment on Web sites via schema.org.  JSON-LD 1.1 completed technical work, about to transition to CR More than 25% of websites today include schema.org data in JSON-LD The Web of Things description is in CR since May, making use of JSON-LD Verifiable Credentials data model is in CR since July, also making use of JSON-LD Continued strong interest in decentralized identifiers Engagement from the TAG with reframing core documents, such as Ethical Web Principles, to include data on the web within their scope Data is increasingly important for all organizations, especially with the rise of IoT and Big Data. W3C has a mature and extensive suite of standards relating to data that were developed over two decades of experience, with plans for further work on making it easier for developers to work with graph data and knowledge graphs.  Linked Data is about the use of URIs as names for things, the ability to dereference these URIs to get further information and to include links to other data. There are ever-increasing sources of open Linked Data on the Web, as well as data services that are restricted to the suppliers and consumers of those services.  The digital transformation of industry is seeking to exploit advanced digital technologies. This will facilitate businesses to integrate horizontally along the supply and value chains, and vertically from the factory floor to the office floor. W3C is seeking to make it easier to support enterprise-wide data management and governance, reflecting the strategic importance of data to modern businesses.  Traditional approaches to data have focused on tabular databases (SQL/RDBMS), Comma Separated Value (CSV) files, and data embedded in PDF documents and spreadsheets. We're now in midst of a major shift to graph data with nodes and labeled directed links between them. Graph data is:  Faster than using SQL and associated JOIN operations More favorable to integrating data from heterogeneous sources Better suited to situations where the data model is evolving In the wake of the recent W3C Workshop on Graph Data we are in the process of launching a Graph Standardization Business Group to provide a business perspective with use cases and requirements, to coordinate technical standards work and liaisons with external organizations.  Web for All Security, Privacy, Identity  All Security specifications, all Privacy specifications  Authentication on the Web   As the WebAuthn Level 1 W3C Recommendation published last March is seeing wide implementation and adoption of strong cryptographic authentication, work is proceeding on Level 2.  The open standard Web API gives native authentication technology built into native platforms, browsers, operating systems (including mobile) and hardware, offering protection against hacking, credential theft, phishing attacks, thus aiming to end the era of passwords as a security construct. You may read more in our March press release.  Privacy  An increasing number of W3C specifications are benefitting from Privacy and Security review; there are security and privacy aspects to every specification. Early review is essential. Working with the TAG, the Privacy Interest Group has updated the Self-Review Questionnaire: Security and Privacy.  Other recent work of the group includes public blogging further to the exploration of anti-patterns in standards and permission prompts.  Security  The Web Application Security Working Group adopted Feature Policy, aiming to allow developers to selectively enable, disable, or modify the behavior of some of these browser features and APIs within their application; and Fetch Metadata, aiming to provide servers with enough information to make a priori decisions about whether or not to service a request based on the way it was made, and the context in which it will be used.  The Web Payment Security Interest Group, launched last April, convenes members from W3C, EMVCo, and the FIDO Alliance to discuss cooperative work to enhance the security and interoperability of Web payments (read more about payments).  Internationalization (i18n)   All Internationalization specifications, educational articles related to Internationalization, spec developers checklist  Only a quarter or so current Web users use English online and that proportion will continue to decrease as the Web reaches more and more communities of limited English proficiency. If the Web is to live up to the ""World Wide"" portion of its name, and for the Web to truly work for stakeholders all around the world engaging with content in various languages, it must support the needs of worldwide users as they engage with content in the various languages. The growth of epublishing also brings requirements for new features and improved typography on the Web. It is important to ensure the needs of local communities are captured.  The W3C Internationalization Initiative was set up to increase in-house resources dedicated to accelerating progress in making the World Wide Web ""worldwide"" by gathering user requirements, supporting developers, and education & outreach.  For an overview of current projects see the i18n radar. W3C's Internationalization efforts progressed on a number of fronts recently:  Requirements: New African and European language groups will work on the gap analysis, errata and layout requirements. Gap analysis: Japanese, Devanagari, Bengali, Tamil, Lao, Khmer, Javanese, and Ethiopic updated in the gap-analysis documents. Layout requirements document: notable progress tracked in the Southeast Asian Task Force while work continues on Chinese layout requirements. Developer support: Spec reviews: the i18n WG continues active review of specifications of the WHATWG and other W3C Working Groups. Short review checklist: easy way to begin a self-review to help spec developers understand what aspects of their spec are likely to need attention for internationalization, and points them to more detailed checklists for the relevant topics. It also helps those reviewing specs for i18n issues. Strings on the Web: Language and Direction Metadata lays out issues and discusses potential solutions for passing information about language and direction with strings in JSON or other data formats. The document was rewritten for clarity, and expanded. The group is collaborating with the JSON-LD and Web Publishing groups to develop a plan for updating RDF, JSON-LD and related specifications to handle metadata for base direction of text (bidi). User-friendly test format: a new format was developed for Internationalization Test Suite tests, which displays helpful information about how the test works. This particularly useful because those tests are pointed to by educational materials and gap-analysis documents. Web Platform Tests: a large number of tests in the i18n test suite have been ported to the WPT repository, including: css-counter-styles, css-ruby, css-syntax, css-test, css-text-decor, css-writing-modes, and css-pseudo. Education & outreach: (for all educational materials, see the HTML & CSS Authoring Techniques) Web Accessibility   All Accessibility specifications, WAI resources  The Web Accessibility Initiative supports W3C's Web for All mission. Recent achievements include:  Education and training: Inaccessibility of CAPTCHA updated to bring our analysis and recommendations up to date with CAPTCHA practice today, concluding two years of extensive work and invaluable input from the public (read more on the W3C Blog Learn why your web content and applications should be accessible. The Education and Outreach Working Group has completed revision and updating of the Business Case for Digital Accessibility. Accessibility guidelines: The Accessibility Guidelines Working Group has continued to update WCAG Techniques and Understanding WCAG 2.1; and published a Candidate Recommendation of Accessibility Conformance Testing Rules Format 1.0 to improve inter-rater reliability when evaluating conformance of web content to WCAG An updated charter is being developed to host work on ""Silver"", the next generation accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.2) There are accessibility aspects to most specifications. Check your work with the FAST checklist.  Outreach to the world W3C Developer Relations   To foster the excellent feedback loop between Web Standards development and Web developers, and to grow participation from that diverse community, recent W3C Developer Relations activities include:  @w3cdevs tracks the enormous amount of work happening across W3C W3C Track during the Web Conference 2019 in San Francisco Tech videos: W3C published the 2019 Web Games Workshop videos The 16 September 2019 Developer Meetup in Fukuoka, Japan, is open to all and will combine a set of technical demos prepared by W3C groups, and a series of talks on a selected set of W3C technologies and projects W3C is involved with Mozilla, Google, Samsung, Microsoft and Bocoup in the organization of ViewSource 2019 in Amsterdam (read more on the W3C Blog) W3C Training   In partnership with EdX, W3C's MOOC training program, W3Cx offers a complete ""Front-End Web Developer"" (FEWD) professional certificate program that consists of a suite of five courses on the foundational languages that power the Web: HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. We count nearly 900K students from all over the world.  Translations  Many Web users rely on translations of documents developed at W3C whose official language is English. W3C is extremely grateful to the continuous efforts of its community in ensuring our various deliverables in general, and in our specifications in particular, are made available in other languages, for free, ensuring their exposure to a much more diverse set of readers.  Last Spring we developed a more robust system, a new listing of translations of W3C specifications and updated the instructions on how to contribute to our translation efforts.  W3C Liaisons   Liaisons and coordination with numerous organizations and Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) is crucial for W3C to:  make sure standards are interoperable coordinate our respective agenda in Internet governance: W3C participates in ICANN, GIPO, IGF, the I* organizations (ICANN, IETF, ISOC, IAB). ensure at the government liaison level that our standards work is officially recognized when important to our membership so that products based on them (often done by our members) are part of procurement orders. W3C has ARO/PAS status with ISO. W3C participates in the EU MSP and Rolling Plan on Standardization ensure the global set of Web and Internet standards form a compatible stack of technologies, at the technical and policy level (patent regime, fragmentation, use in policy making) promote Standards adoption equally by the industry, the public sector, and the public at large Coralie Mercier, Editor, W3C Marketing & Communications $Id: Overview.html,v 1.60 2019/10/15 12:05:52 coralie Exp $ Copyright © 2019 W3C ® (MIT, ERCIM, Keio, Beihang) Usage policies apply.",7,20,7,customer+tool+manage,GitHub

Support Dashboard Card Payments Quickstart Securely collect card information from your customers and create a card payment.  Supported cards Users in the United States can accept Visa Mastercard American Express Discover JCB Diners Club credit and debit cards.  Stripe also supports a range of additional payment methods, depending on the country of your Stripe account.  Accepting a card payment using Stripe is a two-step process, with a client-side and a server-side action:  From your website running in the customer’s browser, Stripe securely collects your customer’s payment information and returns a representative token. This, along with any other form data, is then submitted by the browser to your server. Using the token, your server-side code makes an API request to create a charge and complete the payment. Tokenization ensures that no sensitive card data ever needs to touch your server so your integration can operate in a PCI compliant way.  Step 1: Securely collecting payment information  Checkout reference Complete information about available options and parameters is provided in the Checkout reference.  The simplest way for you to securely collect and tokenize card information is with Checkout. It combines HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to create an embedded payment form. When your customer enters their payment information, the card details are validated and tokenized for your server-side code to use.  To see Checkout in action, click the button below, filling in the resulting form with:  Any random, syntactically valid email address (the more random, the better) One of Stripe’s test card numbers, such as 4242 4242 4242 4242 Any three-digit CVC code Any expiration date in the future To get started, add the following code to your payment page, making sure that the form submits to your own server-side code:  <form action=""your-server-side-code"" method=""POST"">   <script     src=""https://checkout.stripe.com/checkout.js"" class=""stripe-button""     data-key=""pk_test_2DtHIU1N9li5GpmJjyxkQMHh""     data-amount=""999""     data-name=""Demo Site""     data-description=""Example charge""     data-image=""https://stripe.com/img/documentation/checkout/marketplace.png""     data-locale=""auto"">   </script> </form> We’ve pre-filled the data-key attribute with your test publishable API key—only you can see this value. When you’re ready to go live with your payment form, you must replace the test key with your live key. Learn more about how the keys play into test and live modes.  Although optional, we highly recommend also having Checkout collect the user’s ZIP code, as address and ZIP code verifications help reduce fraud. Add data-zip-code=""true"" to the above and enable declines on verification failures in your account settings. You can also set Checkout to collect the user’s full billing and shipping addresses (using the corresponding parameters).  Requiring more than the minimum information lowers the possibility of a payment being declined or disputed in the future. Any fraudulent payments that you process are ultimately your responsibility, so requiring a little more than the minimum amount of information is an effective way to combat fraud.  Radar, our modern suite of fraud protection tools, is only available to users who have implemented client-side tokenization. By doing so, it ensures that you can pass the necessary data required for our machine-learning fraud prevention models to make more accurate predictions.  The amount provided in the Checkout form code is only shown to the user. It does not set the amount that the customer will be charged—you must also specify an amount when making a charge request. As you build your integration, make sure that your payment form and server-side code use the same amount to avoid confusion.  An alternative to the blue button demonstrated above is to implement a custom Checkout integration. The custom approach allows you to use any HTML element or JavaScript event to open Checkout, as well as be able to specify dynamic arguments, such as custom amounts.  Stripe.js and Elements If you’d prefer to have complete control over the look and fel of your payment form, you can make use of Stripe.js and Elements, our pre-built UI components. Refer to our Elements quickstart to learn more.  Mobile SDKs Using our native mobile libraries for iOS and Android, Stripe can collect your customer’s payment information from within your mobile app and create a token for your server-side code to use.  Step 2: Creating a charge to complete the payment  Once a token is created, your server-side code makes an API request to create a one-time charge. This request contains the token, currency, amount to charge, and any additional information you may want to pass (e.g., metadata).  curl Ruby Python PHP Java Node Go .NET curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges \    -u sk_test_fyzWf8eDyljIob76fMVSwIsi: \    -d amount=999 \    -d currency=usd \    -d description=""Example charge"" \    -d source=tok_6Pk6W3hFiGB7dyNavdvyrFkM These requests expect the ID of the Token (e.g., tok_KPte7942xySKBKyrBu11yEpf) to be provided as the value of the source parameter.  Tokens can only be used once, and within a few minutes of creation. Using this approach, your customers need to re-enter their payment details each time they make a purchase. You can also save card details with Stripe for later use. Using this method, returning customers can quickly make a payment without providing their card details again.  Next steps Congrats! You can now accept card payments with Stripe using Checkout.

See ""[Differences between GitHub Apps and OAuth Apps](/apps/differences-between-apps/)"" for more details. - Apps should use the principle of least privilege and should only request the OAuth scopes and GitHub App permissions that the app needs to perform its intended functionality. For more information, see [Principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) in Wikipedia. - Apps should provide customers with a way to delete their account, without having to email or call a support person. - Apps should not share tokens between different implementations of the app. For example, a desktop app should have a separate token from a web-based app. Individual tokens allow each app to request the access needed for GitHub resources separately. - Design your app with different user roles, depending on the functionality needed by each type of user. For example, a standard user should not have access to admin functionality, and billing managers might not need push access to repository code. - Apps should not share service accounts such as email or database services to manage your SaaS service. - All services used in your app should have unique login and password credentials. - Admin privilege access to the production hosting infrastructure should only be given to engineers and employees with administrative duties. - Apps should not use personal access tokens to authenticate and should authenticate as an [OAuth App](/apps/about-apps/#about-oauth-apps) or a [GitHub App](/apps/about-apps/#about-github-apps):   - OAuth Apps should authenticate using an [OAuth token](/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps/).   - GitHub Apps should authenticate using either a [JSON Web Token (JWT)](/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps/#authenticating-as-a-github-app), [OAuth token](/apps/building-github-apps/identifying-and-authorizing-users-for-github-apps/), or [installation access token](/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps/#authenticating-as-an-installation).  ### Data protection  - Apps should encrypt data transferred over the public internet using HTTPS, with a valid TLS certificate, or SSH for Git. - Apps should store client ID and client secret keys securely. We recommend storing them as [environmental variables](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable#Getting_and_setting_environment_variables). - Apps should delete all GitHub user data within 30 days of receiving a request from the user, or within 30 days of the end of the user's legal relationship with GitHub. - Apps should not require the user to provide their GitHub password. - Apps should encrypt tokens, client IDs, and client secrets.  ### Logging and monitoring  Apps should have logging and monitoring capabilities. App logs should be retained for at least 30 days and archived for at least one year. A security log should include:  - Authentication and authorization events - Service configuration changes - Object reads and writes - All user and group permission changes - Elevation of role to admin - Consistent timestamping for each event - Source users, IP addresses, and/or hostnames for all logged actions  ### Incident response workflow  To provide a secure experience for users, you should have a clear incident response plan in place before listing your app. We recommend having a security and operations incident response team in your company rather than using a third-party vendor. You should have the capability to notify {% data variables.product.product_name %} within 24 hours of a confirmed incident.  For an example of an incident response workflow, see the ""Data Breach Response Policy"" on the [SANS Institute website](https://www.sans.org/information-security-policy/). A short document with clear steps to take in the event of an incident is more valuable than a lengthy policy template.  ### Vulnerability management and patching workflow  You should conduct regular vulnerability scans of production infrastructure. You should triage the results of vulnerability scans and define a period of time in which you agree to remediate the vulnerability.  If you are not ready to set up a full vulnerability management program, it's useful to start by creating a patching process.

Our group is to implement a logistic information system based on Oracle Transportation Management system (OTM). We tailor solutions for a Japanese company by developing and implementing OTM which enables them to meet their customer service and logistics objectives by managing all orders and shipments, both domestic and international. Logistics systems require large amounts of data, including information about locations, geography, service providers, rates, itineraries, as well as transactional data such as orders and shipment status. Much of this data comes from traditional Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. To implement the interface and communication between OTM and ERP is my main job. In this project, I need to develop programs that can parse and transfer JSON data between the OTM system and ERP system because tools and techniques for data integration in-built in OTM has its imitation, which means it can only process xml-based and EDI-based integration.

Without further trouble, let's go ahead as well as dive in with action # 1. Action 1: How to onboard a brand-new advertising project Whether you are beginning a new marketing campaign from square one or you are inheriting an existing advertising campaign, it is really important to recognize 2 things. # 1 You require to develop your advertising goals. Now usually we have clients that will certainly claim their objective is to obtain more sales. Yet that is an extremely high-level goal.

And also honestly, you wish to be as sensible as possible because that's the accountable thing to do as a great online marketer. A lot of people strive for the over night success desire, however the fact is excellent marketing can require time. Now that you have established you require to establish some advertising goals and also a spending plan, after that you can transfer to tip number two, which is ""just how to structure your advertising strategy."" Action 2: Exactly how to structure your advertising plan The first thing we suggest that you do is to develop an advertising and marketing channel, or really plainly recognize the advertising and marketing channel that already exists. If your business is already generating any type of sales, after that you likely have an advertising and marketing channel whether you understand it or not. It is necessary to recognize which part of the funnel you will certainly need to influence with your advertising project. Understanding the advertising channel will help you pinpoint which stage of the channel demands adjustments. To get a far better understanding of the advertising and marketing channel, let's take a more detailed look at an advertising funnel as well as break down an advertising funnel for B2C (service to customer) as well as B2B (organization to service) firms. At the top of the channel you have the recognition stage. For both B2B or B2C companies this is where potential consumers become aware of your company either by means of search, or an advertisement, or a person referring them to you. The next part of the channel is the interest stage. This is where your capacity clients start to read more concerning your product and services. After that phase of the channel is the consideration stage. This is where your capacity customers actually begin thinking about buying your products. They might begin to review your evaluations or compare your products to others that are on the market. After the consideration stage is the intent phase. This is the stage where the potential client prepares to buy as well as simply needs a little push to complete the transaction. If you're a B2C firm, that implies that a visitor has perhaps added something to their cart. And also if you're a B2B firm, that implies that a site visitor may have asked for a meeting or a live trial. Swiftly after that, the prospective consumer enters the examination stage. This is when the potential consumer is considering the experience they are having as they are having a look at for a B2C company or finishing the contract for a B2B firm. At the really bottom of the channel you have the actual purchase, which is when the potential client becomes a real consumer. As you can see, there is a whole process to getting a client to really end up being a client. On top of that, a channel can continue after the acquisition factor, particularly if you wish to get even more sales from your present consumers. However those phases we pointed out are mosting likely to be the major locations that the majority of marketing managers require to focus on. Nevertheless, if you wish to discover a bit a lot more concerning marketing funnels, check out this blog where we go a lot more thorough with the advertising and marketing channel phases. As you are doing your marketing administration, you wish to begin asking on your own, ""Which stage in the advertising and marketing channel does my organization require the most assist with?"" You will discover that some business require general understanding prior to they can enhance any other part of their funnel. You may additionally locate that some business have a lot of awareness, yet battle to convert those introduce sales. However, once you recognize where your marketing needs one of the most aid, then you can concentrate there and also start to establish those leading indication objectives. For example, in the recognition stage, you have to focus on getting to a great deal of people. And also if business spending plan you have actually established is reduced, that suggests you will likely require to make use of an organic advertising and marketing approach. Currently let's move on to tip number three, which is just how to establish your advertising and marketing projects Action 3: How to set up your marketing campaigns. The first thing you need to think of below is production. What we indicate by ""production"" is you need to understand WHO or WHAT you require and WHEN you require it.

For example, if you are publishing on YouTube on a daily basis for six months as well as you are not obtaining any kind of sights whatsoever, then that is an indication that you require to quit and reassess your advertising strategy.

18,Customer-Churn-Prediction,https://github.com/pachchi/Customer-Churn-Prediction.git,"Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is a comprehensive strategy for building, managing and strengthening loyal and long-lasting customer relationships. It is broadly acknowledged and extensively applied to different fields, for example, telecommunications, banking and insurance, retail market, etc. In any business strategy, one of its main objectives is customer retention. For example, Vodafone should asses the customers’ activities (from their call logs) and hence predict the customers’ churn rate, so that a measure (a special incentive to customers) can be taken to retain them accordingly. The importance of this objective is obvious, given the fact that the cost for customer acquisition is much greater than the cost of customer retention (in some cases it is 20 times more expensive). Thus, tools to develop and apply customer retention models (churn models) are required and are essential Business Analytics applications. In the dynamic market environment, churning could be the result of low-level customer satisfaction, aggressive competitive strategies, new products, regulations, etc. Churn models aim to identify early churn signals and recognize customers with an increased likelihood to leave voluntarily",1,2,1,customer+tool+manage,GitHub

This experimental research is undergone to evaluate different data mining methods on default installments made by clients of a bank in Taiwan. This research was based on analyses and comparison of predictive performance of default payments towards the banking institution using six data mining methods. In the paper, it is demonstrated that the forecasting model created by ANN has the highest coefficient of determination; its regression intercept is near to zero, and regression coefficient to one. The data mining method and their application are used for credit scoring of clients. Data mining methodologies are an amazing tool for decision support system and play a key role in market segmentation, customer segmentation, fraud detection, credit and behavior scoring benchmarking.",0,0,0,customer+tool+manage,GitHub

Businesses don’t need to plan to get many advanced servers and can deliver results quickly by accessing the servers in the cloud virtually within few minutes.  The trend of cloud is rapidly transforming information technology from on-premises computing and software approach where organizations must assemble and manage the resources themselves in data centres. Businesses have bought or leased to the new way, cloud computing where businesses rent instead of buy computing, software and services and the cloud provider manages all the undifferentiated heavy lifting for the underlying infrastructure. As more businesses make the move to the cloud, they are flocking to AWS, providing the money the cloud company can reinvest into launching new services and features every day.   There is lots of cloud noise out, and is causing confusion for potential buyers of cloud computing as to whom to buy from. Should I go with AWS, Microsoft, Google, Oracle, IBM, or others? The list of cloud suppliers is getting longer every day and every cloud supplier is hyping some sort of victory or benefit for customers.  Many cloud competitors are quickly trying to build their own clouds as replicas of AWS while others have abandoned cloud altogether. But many of these vendors are conflicted internally trying to protect and extend the runway for their existing legacy products, which is stifling their innovation.  Amazon offered new web services in the form of IT infrastructure services know as Amazon Web Services for cloud computing. Initially, AWS was primarily used as a cheap way to test things or running a simple website which was developed by small developers. Now most of the companies running small experimental apps in AWS is moving the core of their growing businesses. The early rise of AWS was born for developers building small and cool apps.  AWS’s focus on its customers means that it is not afraid of utilizing itself in inventing new technology. It became clear that AWS’s competitive strategy is twofold. First, keep inventing and releasing more services that solve customers’ problems faster than the competition. And second, don’t be afraid to change which means cannibalizing existing offerings with new, easier, faster, more cost-effective and efficient offerings.  The question for businesses looking to move to the cloud is to determine what technology is cloud technology and which just retrofitted legacy technology is with the term “cloud” affixed to its name. As businesses start seeing the benefits of cloud and the financial results that come with it, they want more cloud, not less.   AWS’s thundering pace of innovation and scale, which has created more capability for customers, also has increased its total addressable market. AWS launches thousand plus features and services every successive year to make it easier in the market to use AWS.  Security and privacy are obstructing the cloud deployment in Malaysia. The most significant issue is comprehending and then minimizing the risks associated with cloud deployment. This problem is more significant in off-premise clouds, where contents are stored on the cloud vendor’s premises. Although data owners have full control over the infrastructure, hardware resources, and software systems with their traditional physical servers or on-premise clouds, it’s nontrivial to enforce the risk of letting contents stay in third-party premises. In this situation, the data owner has limited access to monitor his or her property in the virtual servers in the absence of advanced and detailed cloud-monitoring tools. Another challenge which decelerates cloud adaption is information disclosure from government agencies.   The market wave of the cloud will create lots of value and he is betting that AWS, along with its partner ecosystem of developers and companies, will take most of the share of that value.  The industry shift happens with every big technology innovation, which is when you make something much more cost effective and much faster to get done. People consume more technology with a limitless amount of ideas. More and more people are actually using the cloud, and building more things, and will in the future.

Businesses don’t need to plan to get many advanced servers and can deliver results quickly by accessing the servers in the cloud virtually within few minutes.  The trend of cloud is rapidly transforming information technology from on-premises computing and software approach where organizations must assemble and manage the resources themselves in data centres. Businesses have bought or leased to the new way, cloud computing where businesses rent instead of buy computing, software and services and the cloud provider manages all the undifferentiated heavy lifting for the underlying infrastructure. As more businesses make the move to the cloud, they are flocking to AWS, providing the money the cloud company can reinvest into launching new services and features every day.   There is lots of cloud noise out, and is causing confusion for potential buyers of cloud computing as to whom to buy from. Should I go with AWS, Microsoft, Google, Oracle, IBM, or others? The list of cloud suppliers is getting longer every day and every cloud supplier is hyping some sort of victory or benefit for customers.  Many cloud competitors are quickly trying to build their own clouds as replicas of AWS while others have abandoned cloud altogether. But many of these vendors are conflicted internally trying to protect and extend the runway for their existing legacy products, which is stifling their innovation.
