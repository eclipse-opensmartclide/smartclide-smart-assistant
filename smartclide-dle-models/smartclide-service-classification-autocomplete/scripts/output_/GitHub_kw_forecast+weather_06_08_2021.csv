Climate related data is important to analyse agricultural and crop seeding related field, where those data can be used to show the predict the rainfall in different season also for different types of crops. Developed application can be found from http://ml.bigalogy.com/ Paper: http://dspace.uiu.ac.bd/handle/52243/178 Abstract Mankind have been attempting to predict the weather from prehistory. For good reason for knowing when to plant crops, when to build and when to prepare for drought and flood. In a nation such as Bangladesh being able to predict the weather, especially rainfall has never been so vitally important. The proposed research work pursues to produce prediction model on rainfall using the machine learning algorithms. The base data for this work has been collected from Bangladesh Meteorological Department. It is mainly focused on the development of models for long term rainfall prediction of Bangladesh divisions and districts (Weather Stations). Rainfall prediction is very important for the Bangladesh economy and day to day life. Scarcity or heavy - both rainfall effects rural and urban life to a great extent with the changing pattern of the climate. Unusual rainfall and long lasting rainy season is a great factor to take account into. We want to see whether too much unusual behavior is taking place another pattern resulting new clamatorial description. As agriculture is dependent on rain and heavy rainfall caused flood frequently leading to great loss to crops, rainfall is a very complex phenomenon which is dependent on various atmospheric, oceanic and geographical parameters. The relationship between these parameters and rainfall is unstable. Beside this changing behavior of clamatorial facts making the existing meteorological forecasting less usable to the users.  Initially linear regression models were developed for monthly rainfall prediction of station and national level as per day month year. Here humidity, temperatures & wind parameters are used as predictors. The study is further extended by developing another popular regression analysis algorithm named Random Forest Regression. After then, few other classification algorithms have been used for model building, training and prediction. Those are Naive Bayes Classification, Decision Tree Classification (Entropy and Gini) and Random Forest Classification. In all model building and training predictor parameters were Station, Year, Month and Day. As the effect of rainfall affecting parameters is embedded in rainfall, rainfall was the label or dependent variable in these models. The developed and trained model is capable of predicting rainfall in advance for a month of a given year for a given area (for area we used here are the stations (weather parameters values are measured by Bangladesh Meteorological Department). The accuracy of rainfall estimation is above 65%. Accuracy percentage varies from algorithm to algorithm.  Two regression analysis and three classification analysis models has been developed for rainfall prediction of 33 Bangladeshi weather station. Apache Spark library has been used for machine library in Scala programming language. The main idea behind the use of classification and regression analysis is to see the comparative difference between types of algorithms prediction output and the predictability along with usability.  This thesis is a contribution to the effort of rainfall prediction within Bangladesh. It takes the strategy of applying machine learning models to historical weather data gathered in Bangladesh. As part of this work, a web-based software application was written using Apache Spark, Scala and HighCharts to demonstrate rainfall prediction using multiple machine learning models. Models are successively improved with the rainfall prediction accuracy.  Content The given data has weather station and year wise monthly rainfall data of Bangladesh. Data is two format - 46 year (33 Weather Station) : From 1970 to 2016  Daily Rainfall Data  Monthly Rainfall Data Columns:  Station (Weather Station, along with Station Index) Year Month Day [For daily data file]",11,4,11,forecast+weather,GitHub

For example, ship navigation and weather forecast. Accurate and robust classification methods of multi-year ice and first-year ice are in demand [2]. Hybrid-polarity SAR architecture will be included in future SAR missions such as the Canadian RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM). These sensors will enable the use of compact polarimetry (CP) data in wide swath imagery [1]. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are becoming increasingly popular in many research communities due to availability of large image datasets and high-performance computing systems. As Convolutional networks (ConvNets) have achieved great success on many image classification tasks, I pursue this method for the classification of image patches from compact polarimety (CP) imagery into first-year ice and multi-year ice is applicable. In this course project, my work is kind of like the first practice of the CP imagery classification by fine-tuning a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN). Specifically, fine-tuning the last fully-connected layer of a pre-trained convolutional networks, I extract patches from simulated CP images as my dataset, the classification accuracy of the test set achieved 91.3% by fine-tuning a pre-trained CNN, compared to 49.4% classification accuracy by training from scratch.",7,7,7,forecast+weather,GitHub

275,HiRAM,https://github.com/FMS-ESM/HiRAM.git,"HiRAM, the GFDL global HIgh Resolution Atmospheric Model, was developed with a goal of providing an improved representation of significant weather events in a global climate model. Our intention was to produce a model capable of simulating the statistics of tropical storms, with sufficient fidelity that it can be used with confidence to study the causes of year-to-year variability in storm activity, recent trends in activity, as well as the predictability of the Atlantic hurricane season. As the credibility of the model improves, based on comparisons with observations, we will apply it to study the effects of global warming on tropical storms.  HiRAM was developed based on AM2 (GAMDT 2004) with increased horizontal and vertical resolutions, as well as simplified parameterizations for moist convection and large-scale (stratiform) cloudiness. The idea behind the simplifications in physics is to make the parameterized convection less intrusive so that explicit convection can make significant contributions to the vertical transport of water and energy in the tropics. The idea of the parameterized convection helping the resolved scale convection, rather than supplanting it entirely, is a strategy that we believe will be useful in working with global models with finer and finer resolution, as the resolved convection begins to take on some realistic features (Pauluis and Garner, 2006).  Specific changes from AM2 include: 1) the finite-volume dynamical core (Lin 2004) on a latitude-longitude grid has been replaced by a finite-volume core using a cubed-sphere grid topology (Putman and Lin 2007) with a quasi-uniform horizontal grid spacing; 2) the number of vertical levels has been increased from 24 to 32; 3) the relaxed Arakawa-Schubert convective closure (Moorthi and Suarez 1992) in AM2 has been replaced by a scheme based on the parameterization of shallow convection by Bretherton et al. (2004); and 4) the prognostic cloud fraction scheme has been replaced by a simpler diagnostic scheme assuming a sub-grid scale distribution of total water.  HiRAM retains the surface flux, boundary layer, land surface, gravity wave drag, large-scale cloud microphysics, and radiative transfer modules from AM2. See Zhao et al. (2009) for more details about the modifications.  At about 50km horizontal grid size, the HIRAM (C180-HIRAM) forced by the observed ocean surface temperatures is found to be able to simulate many aspects of the observed tropical cyclone frequency variability for the past few decades, for which reliable observations are available (Zhao et al. 2009). These include the geographical distribution of global hurricane tracks, the seasonal cycle, as well as the inter-annual variability and the decadal trend of hurricane frequency over multiple ocean basins.  HiRAM has been used to study hurricane seasonal forecast in the N. Atlantic (Zhao et al. 2010, Chen and Lin 2011) and the results support the view that the overall activity of the Atlantic hurricane season has substantial predictability, if we can predict ocean temperatures. These studies also motivate the development of the GFDL Hybrid Hurricane Forecast System (HyHUFS, Vecchi et al. 2011).  HiRAM has also been used to study the response of tropical storms to global warming and CO2 increase (Held and Zhao 2011, Zhao and Held 2010, 2012). HIRAM is also a GFDL model currently participating in the CMIP5 high resolution time-slice simulations (Held et al., in preparation) and the US CLIVAR Hurricane Working Group.  The HiRAM atmospheric model is coupled to the new land model LM3, shared by all of the GFDL models contributed to CMIP5.http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/hiram",6,8,6,forecast+weather,GitHub

Climate related data is important to analyse agricultural and crop seeding related field, where those data can be used to show the predict the rainfall in different season also for different types of crops. Developed application can be found from http://ml.bigalogy.com/ Paper: http://dspace.uiu.ac.bd/handle/52243/178 Abstract Mankind have been attempting to predict the weather from prehistory. For good reason for knowing when to plant crops, when to build and when to prepare for drought and flood. In a nation such as Bangladesh being able to predict the weather, especially rainfall has never been so vitally important. The proposed research work pursues to produce prediction model on rainfall using the machine learning algorithms. The base data for this work has been collected from Bangladesh Meteorological Department. It is mainly focused on the development of models for long term rainfall prediction of Bangladesh divisions and districts (Weather Stations). Rainfall prediction is very important for the Bangladesh economy and day to day life. Scarcity or heavy - both rainfall effects rural and urban life to a great extent with the changing pattern of the climate. Unusual rainfall and long lasting rainy season is a great factor to take account into. We want to see whether too much unusual behavior is taking place another pattern resulting new clamatorial description. As agriculture is dependent on rain and heavy rainfall caused flood frequently leading to great loss to crops, rainfall is a very complex phenomenon which is dependent on various atmospheric, oceanic and geographical parameters. The relationship between these parameters and rainfall is unstable. Beside this changing behavior of clamatorial facts making the existing meteorological forecasting less usable to the users.  Initially linear regression models were developed for monthly rainfall prediction of station and national level as per day month year. Here humidity, temperatures & wind parameters are used as predictors. The study is further extended by developing another popular regression analysis algorithm named Random Forest Regression. After then, few other classification algorithms have been used for model building, training and prediction. Those are Naive Bayes Classification, Decision Tree Classification (Entropy and Gini) and Random Forest Classification. In all model building and training predictor parameters were Station, Year, Month and Day. As the effect of rainfall affecting parameters is embedded in rainfall, rainfall was the label or dependent variable in these models. The developed and trained model is capable of predicting rainfall in advance for a month of a given year for a given area (for area we used here are the stations (weather parameters values are measured by Bangladesh Meteorological Department). The accuracy of rainfall estimation is above 65%. Accuracy percentage varies from algorithm to algorithm.  Two regression analysis and three classification analysis models has been developed for rainfall prediction of 33 Bangladeshi weather station. Apache Spark library has been used for machine library in Scala programming language. The main idea behind the use of classification and regression analysis is to see the comparative difference between types of algorithms prediction output and the predictability along with usability.  This thesis is a contribution to the effort of rainfall prediction within Bangladesh. It takes the strategy of applying machine learning models to historical weather data gathered in Bangladesh. As part of this work, a web-based software application was written using Apache Spark, Scala and HighCharts to demonstrate rainfall prediction using multiple machine learning models. Models are successively improved with the rainfall prediction accuracy.  Content The given data has weather station and year wise monthly rainfall data of Bangladesh. Data is two format - 46 year (33 Weather Station) : From 1970 to 2016  Daily Rainfall Data  Monthly Rainfall Data Columns:  Station (Weather Station, along with Station Index) Year Month Day [For daily data file]",11,4,11,forecast+weather,GitHub

For example, ship navigation and weather forecast. Accurate and robust classification methods of multi-year ice and first-year ice are in demand [2]. Hybrid-polarity SAR architecture will be included in future SAR missions such as the Canadian RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM). These sensors will enable the use of compact polarimetry (CP) data in wide swath imagery [1]. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are becoming increasingly popular in many research communities due to availability of large image datasets and high-performance computing systems. As Convolutional networks (ConvNets) have achieved great success on many image classification tasks, I pursue this method for the classification of image patches from compact polarimety (CP) imagery into first-year ice and multi-year ice is applicable. In this course project, my work is kind of like the first practice of the CP imagery classification by fine-tuning a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN). Specifically, fine-tuning the last fully-connected layer of a pre-trained convolutional networks, I extract patches from simulated CP images as my dataset, the classification accuracy of the test set achieved 91.3% by fine-tuning a pre-trained CNN, compared to 49.4% classification accuracy by training from scratch.",7,7,7,forecast+weather,GitHub

670,HiRAM,https://github.com/FMS-ESM/HiRAM.git,"HiRAM, the GFDL global HIgh Resolution Atmospheric Model, was developed with a goal of providing an improved representation of significant weather events in a global climate model. Our intention was to produce a model capable of simulating the statistics of tropical storms, with sufficient fidelity that it can be used with confidence to study the causes of year-to-year variability in storm activity, recent trends in activity, as well as the predictability of the Atlantic hurricane season. As the credibility of the model improves, based on comparisons with observations, we will apply it to study the effects of global warming on tropical storms.  HiRAM was developed based on AM2 (GAMDT 2004) with increased horizontal and vertical resolutions, as well as simplified parameterizations for moist convection and large-scale (stratiform) cloudiness. The idea behind the simplifications in physics is to make the parameterized convection less intrusive so that explicit convection can make significant contributions to the vertical transport of water and energy in the tropics. The idea of the parameterized convection helping the resolved scale convection, rather than supplanting it entirely, is a strategy that we believe will be useful in working with global models with finer and finer resolution, as the resolved convection begins to take on some realistic features (Pauluis and Garner, 2006).  Specific changes from AM2 include: 1) the finite-volume dynamical core (Lin 2004) on a latitude-longitude grid has been replaced by a finite-volume core using a cubed-sphere grid topology (Putman and Lin 2007) with a quasi-uniform horizontal grid spacing; 2) the number of vertical levels has been increased from 24 to 32; 3) the relaxed Arakawa-Schubert convective closure (Moorthi and Suarez 1992) in AM2 has been replaced by a scheme based on the parameterization of shallow convection by Bretherton et al. (2004); and 4) the prognostic cloud fraction scheme has been replaced by a simpler diagnostic scheme assuming a sub-grid scale distribution of total water.  HiRAM retains the surface flux, boundary layer, land surface, gravity wave drag, large-scale cloud microphysics, and radiative transfer modules from AM2. See Zhao et al. (2009) for more details about the modifications.  At about 50km horizontal grid size, the HIRAM (C180-HIRAM) forced by the observed ocean surface temperatures is found to be able to simulate many aspects of the observed tropical cyclone frequency variability for the past few decades, for which reliable observations are available (Zhao et al. 2009). These include the geographical distribution of global hurricane tracks, the seasonal cycle, as well as the inter-annual variability and the decadal trend of hurricane frequency over multiple ocean basins.  HiRAM has been used to study hurricane seasonal forecast in the N. Atlantic (Zhao et al. 2010, Chen and Lin 2011) and the results support the view that the overall activity of the Atlantic hurricane season has substantial predictability, if we can predict ocean temperatures. These studies also motivate the development of the GFDL Hybrid Hurricane Forecast System (HyHUFS, Vecchi et al. 2011).  HiRAM has also been used to study the response of tropical storms to global warming and CO2 increase (Held and Zhao 2011, Zhao and Held 2010, 2012). HIRAM is also a GFDL model currently participating in the CMIP5 high resolution time-slice simulations (Held et al., in preparation) and the US CLIVAR Hurricane Working Group.  The HiRAM atmospheric model is coupled to the new land model LM3, shared by all of the GFDL models contributed to CMIP5.http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/hiram",6,8,6,forecast+weather,GitHub

Can you estimate, as precisely as possible, the point forecasts of the unit sales of various products sold in the USA by Walmart? If you are interested in estimating the uncertainty distribution of the realized values of the same series, be sure to check out its companion competition  How much camping gear will one store sell each month in a year? To the uninitiated, calculating sales at this level may seem as difficult as predicting the weather. Both types of forecasting rely on science and historical data. While a wrong weather forecast may result in you carrying around an umbrella on a sunny day, inaccurate business forecasts could result in actual or opportunity losses. In this competition, in addition to traditional forecasting methods you‚Äôre also challenged to use machine learning to improve forecast accuracy.  The Makridakis Open Forecasting Center (MOFC) at the University of Nicosia conducts cutting-edge forecasting research and provides business forecast training. It helps companies achieve accurate predictions, estimate the levels of uncertainty, avoiding costly mistakes, and apply best forecasting practices. The MOFC is well known for its Makridakis Competitions, the first of which ran in the 1980s.  In this competition, the fifth iteration, you will use hierarchical sales data from Walmart, the world‚Äôs largest company by revenue, to forecast daily sales for the next 28 days. The data, covers stores in three US States (California, Texas, and Wisconsin) and includes item level, department, product categories, and store details. In addition, it has explanatory variables such as price, promotions, day of the week, and special events. Together, this robust dataset can be used to improve forecasting accuracy.  If successful, your work will continue to advance the theory and practice of forecasting. The methods used can be applied in various business areas, such as setting up appropriate inventory or service levels. Through its business support and training, the MOFC will help distribute the tools and knowledge so others can achieve more accurate and better calibrated forecasts, reduce waste and be able to appreciate uncertainty and its risk implications.

966,Bluebikes-project,https://github.com/janeminmin/Bluebikes-project.git,"1>  Background information Bluebikes is Metro Boston‚Äôs public bike share program, with more than 1800 bikes at over 200 stations across Boston and nearby areas. The bikes sharing program launched in 2011. The program aimed for individuals to use it for short-term basis for a price. It allows individuals to borrow a bike from a dock station after using it, which makes it ideal for one-way trips. The City of Boston is committed to providing bike share as a part of the public transportation system. However, to build a transport system that encourages bicycling, it is important to build knowledge about the current bicycle flows, and what factors are involved in the decision-making of potential bicyclists when choosing whether to use the bicycle. It is logical to make hypotheses that age and gender, bicycle infrastructure, safety perception are possible determinants of bicycling. On the short-term perspective, it has been shown that weather plays an important role whether to choose the bicycle.  2> Data collection The Bluebikes collects and provides system data to the public. The datasets used in the project can be download through this link (https://www.bluebikes.com/system-data). Based on this time series dataset (start from 2017-01-01 00:00:00 to 2019-03-31 23:00:00), we could have the information includes: Trip duration, start time and data, stop time and data, start station name and id, end station name and id, bike id, user type (casual or subscribed), birth year, gender. Besides, any trips that were below 60 seconds in length is considered as potentially false starts, which is already removed in the datasets. The number of bicycles used during a particular time period, varies over time based on several factors, including the current weather conditions, time of the day, time of the year and the current interest of the biker to use the bicycle as a transport mode. The current interest is different between subscribed users and casual users, so we should analyze them separately. Factors such as season, day of a week, month, hour, and if a holiday can be extracted from the date and time column in the datasets. Since we would analyze the hourly bicycle rental flow, we need hourly weather conditions data from 2017-01-01 00:00:00 to 2019-03-31 23:00:00 to complete our regression model of prediction. The weather data used in the project is scrapped using python selenium from Logan airport station (42.38 ¬∞N, 71.04 ¬∞W) webpage (https://www.wunderground.com/history/daily/us/ma/boston/KBOS/date/2019-7-15) maintained by weather underground website. The hourly weather observations include time, temperature, dew point, humidity, wind, wind speed, wind gust, pressure, precipitation, precipitation accumulated, condition. 3> The problem The aims of the project are to gain insight of the factors that could give short-term perspective of bicycle flows in Boston. It also aimed to investigate the how busy each station is, the division of bicycle trip direction and duration of the usage of a busy station and the mean flows variation within a day or during that period. The addition to the factors included in the regression model, there also exist other factors than influence how the bicycle flows vary over longer periods time. For example, general tendency to use the bicycle. Therefore, there is potential to improve the regression model accuracy by incorporating a long-term trend estimate taken over the time series of bicycle usage. Then the result from the machine learning algorithm-based regression model should be compared with the time series forecasting-based models. 4> Possible solutions Data preprocessing/Exploration and variable selection: date approximation manipulation, correlation analysis among variables, merging data, scrubbing for duplicate data, verifying errors, interpolation for missing values, handling outliers and skewness, binning low frequent levels, encoding categorical variables. Data visualization: split number of bike usage by subscribed/casual to build time series; build heatmap to present how busy is each station and locate the busiest station in the busiest period of a busy day; using boxplot and histogram to check outliers and determine appropriate data transformation, using weather condition text to build word cloud. Time series trend curve estimates: two possible way we considered are fitting polynomials of various degrees to the data points in the time series or by using time series decomposition functions and forecast functions to extract and forecast. We would emphasize on the importance to generate trend curve estimates that do not follow the seasonal variations: the seasonal variations should be captured explicitly by the input weather related variables in the regression model. Prediction/regression/time series forecasting: It is possible to build up multilayer perceptron neural network regressor to build up models and give prediction based on all variables of data, time and weather. However, considering the interpretability of model, we prefer to build regression models based on machine learning algorithms (like random forest or SVM) respectively for subscribed/casual users. Then the regressor would be combined with trend curve extracted and forecasted by ARIMA, and then comparing with the result of time series forecasting by STL (Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess) with multiple seasonal periods and the result of TBATS (Trigonometric Seasonal, Box-Cox Transformation, ARMA residuals, Trend and Seasonality).",3,1,3,forecast+weather,GitHub

Especially, short-term rainfall forecasting is closely related to resident's daily life. For example, forecasting the situation of stagnant water on the road, providing weather guidance for the flight, and providing short-term heavy rainfall warning in the city.However, existing solutions achieve low prediction accuracy for short-term rainfall forecasting. Numerical forecasting models can achieve overall accuracy but always perform worth in some short-term conditions. Data-driven approaches always neglect the influences of physical factors in upstream or downstream regions, which lead to the forecasting accuracy fluctuates in different areas. Rainfall forecasting is affected by many factors, such as high-altitude physical factors and surface factors.High-altitude physical factors play important roles in the movement of rainfall system. Surface factors on the Earth also cause different rainfall. Difference surface factors represent different factors between region and surrounding area. Therefore, it is very reasonable to forecast rainfall by studying the relations between high-altitude physical factors, surface factors and rainfall. In this project, a Dynamic Regional Combined short-term rainfall forecasting model (DRCF) using Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is proposed. The input of the model includes five high-altitude factors and seven different surface factors. In summary, we have addressed a series of techniques challenges in this work, and the central contributions are summarized as follows: 1.Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is used to determined the input of of MPL and a special greedy algorithm is proposed to determine the suitable structure of MLP. 2.The relation between forecasting area and surrounding area is established using MPL. Based on the relation, a dynamic regional combined rainfall forecasting model is proposed. The strategy of dynamically adjusting area is also enhanced to effectively improve prediction accuracy. 3.The model is finally validated by a large number of meteorological site data, including 56 sites, and these sites are distributed in all parts of China.",2,1,2,forecast+weather,GitHub
