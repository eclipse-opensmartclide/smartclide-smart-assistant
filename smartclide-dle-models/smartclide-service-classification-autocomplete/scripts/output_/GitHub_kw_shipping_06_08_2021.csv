298,Jerusalem2020j2IL-Repository,https://github.com/Briechenstein12/Jerusalem2020j2IL-Repository.git," Search documentation... Support Dashboard Card Payments Quickstart Securely collect card information from your customers and create a card payment.  Supported cards Users in the United States can accept Visa Mastercard American Express Discover JCB Diners Club credit and debit cards.  Stripe also supports a range of additional payment methods, depending on the country of your Stripe account.  Accepting a card payment using Stripe is a two-step process, with a client-side and a server-side action:  From your website running in the customer‚Äôs browser, Stripe securely collects your customer‚Äôs payment information and returns a representative token. This, along with any other form data, is then submitted by the browser to your server. Using the token, your server-side code makes an API request to create a charge and complete the payment. Tokenization ensures that no sensitive card data ever needs to touch your server so your integration can operate in a PCI compliant way.  Step 1: Securely collecting payment information  Checkout reference Complete information about available options and parameters is provided in the Checkout reference.  The simplest way for you to securely collect and tokenize card information is with Checkout. It combines HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to create an embedded payment form. When your customer enters their payment information, the card details are validated and tokenized for your server-side code to use.  To see Checkout in action, click the button below, filling in the resulting form with:  Any random, syntactically valid email address (the more random, the better) One of Stripe‚Äôs test card numbers, such as 4242 4242 4242 4242 Any three-digit CVC code Any expiration date in the future To get started, add the following code to your payment page, making sure that the form submits to your own server-side code:  <form action=""your-server-side-code"" method=""POST"">   <script     src=""https://checkout.stripe.com/checkout.js"" class=""stripe-button""     data-key=""pk_test_2DtHIU1N9li5GpmJjyxkQMHh""     data-amount=""999""     data-name=""Demo Site""     data-description=""Example charge""     data-image=""https://stripe.com/img/documentation/checkout/marketplace.png""     data-locale=""auto"">   </script> </form> We‚Äôve pre-filled the data-key attribute with your test publishable API key‚Äîonly you can see this value. When you‚Äôre ready to go live with your payment form, you must replace the test key with your live key. Learn more about how the keys play into test and live modes.  Although optional, we highly recommend also having Checkout collect the user‚Äôs ZIP code, as address and ZIP code verifications help reduce fraud. Add data-zip-code=""true"" to the above and enable declines on verification failures in your account settings. You can also set Checkout to collect the user‚Äôs full billing and shipping addresses (using the corresponding parameters).  Requiring more than the minimum information lowers the possibility of a payment being declined or disputed in the future. Any fraudulent payments that you process are ultimately your responsibility, so requiring a little more than the minimum amount of information is an effective way to combat fraud.  Radar, our modern suite of fraud protection tools, is only available to users who have implemented client-side tokenization. By doing so, it ensures that you can pass the necessary data required for our machine-learning fraud prevention models to make more accurate predictions.  The amount provided in the Checkout form code is only shown to the user. It does not set the amount that the customer will be charged‚Äîyou must also specify an amount when making a charge request. As you build your integration, make sure that your payment form and server-side code use the same amount to avoid confusion.  An alternative to the blue button demonstrated above is to implement a custom Checkout integration. The custom approach allows you to use any HTML element or JavaScript event to open Checkout, as well as be able to specify dynamic arguments, such as custom amounts.  Stripe.js and Elements If you‚Äôd prefer to have complete control over the look and fel of your payment form, you can make use of Stripe.js and Elements, our pre-built UI components. Refer to our Elements quickstart to learn more.  Mobile SDKs Using our native mobile libraries for iOS and Android, Stripe can collect your customer‚Äôs payment information from within your mobile app and create a token for your server-side code to use.  Step 2: Creating a charge to complete the payment  Once a token is created, your server-side code makes an API request to create a one-time charge. This request contains the token, currency, amount to charge, and any additional information you may want to pass (e.g., metadata).  curl Ruby Python PHP Java Node Go .NET curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges \    -u sk_test_fyzWf8eDyljIob76fMVSwIsi: \    -d amount=999 \    -d currency=usd \    -d description=""Example charge"" \    -d source=tok_6Pk6W3hFiGB7dyNavdvyrFkM These requests expect the ID of the Token (e.g., tok_KPte7942xySKBKyrBu11yEpf) to be provided as the value of the source parameter.  Tokens can only be used once, and within a few minutes of creation. Using this approach, your customers need to re-enter their payment details each time they make a purchase. You can also save card details with Stripe for later use. Using this method, returning customers can quickly make a payment without providing their card details again.  Next steps Congrats! You can now accept card payments with Stripe using Checkout.

It supports many popular symbologies (types of bar codes) including EAN-13/UPC-A, UPC-E, EAN-8, Code 128, Code 39, Interleaved 2 of 5 and QR Code.  The flexible, layered implementation facilitates bar code scanning and decoding for any application: use it stand-alone with the included GUI and command line programs, easily integrate a bar code scanning widget into your Qt, GTK+ or PyGTK GUI application, leverage one of the script or programming interfaces (Python, Perl, C++) ...all the way down to a streamlined C library suitable for embedded use.  ZBar is licensed under the GNU LGPL 2.1 to enable development of both open source and commercial projects.

We know the latest ZBarSDK version is '1.3.1' (2012). which is not support for arm64 iOS devices. Since I recompiled the SDK for both simulators and iOS device in arm64, we can keep on developing using ZBarSDK.  For Chinese users, ZBarSDK cannot read QR Code generating by Chinese sometimes. So I recompiled the encoding with GB18030 to solve this embarassment.  Copy the 'libzbar.a' into your project to start QR code work!!  How to generate QR code ?  In this sample, we use ""libqrencode"".(Something about libqrencode, please Google online)  Credits and Version History  If you find any problems with this sample, please file a bug against it.  <Email : 1085952007@qq.com>  1.0 (Nov 2015) was the first shipping version. 1.1 (Jan 2016) added custom view for scanning QR code. 1.2 (May 2016) added custom popView. 1.3 (Jun 2016) use CocoaPods 1.0.1.

472,blackmarket-script,https://github.com/saffeh6/blackmarket-script.git,"Contact : flokif418@gmail.com  About script  Marketplace v2.0 is also written in PHP with Laravel framework. Its using latest standards for encryption (like Sodium library) and security. Its made without use of JavaScript, so its optimized for TOR, but can also be ran normally like any other web app (as you can see on demo).  ¬†  Requirements  VPS with at least 2GB of RAM  Daemon for each coin that is enabled on marketplace  Server requirements:¬†(what software is needed on VPS)  PHP 7 (recommended and tested on 7.2)  SQL Database (MySQL,PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQL Server)  Elasticsearch (Search interface that will keep track of search records and provide great search performance)  Redis (Optional, but will greatly increase app performance )   ¬†Features  Categories Category system is very dynamic. Categories can be nested indefinitely. Creating, deleting and editing of categories is handled in admin panel.  Detailed home page There is placeholder text on the home page at the moment that will represent most important features of your marketplace. On top of that, all users can see Top Vendors (Vendors with most sales), Latest Orders (Products of orders¬†completed¬†most recently, as well as order value, but no information about buyer or seller), Rising Vendors (Vendors with most sales in specified time frame, defaults to 7 days). Official mirrors is place where you can specify on what other links your website can be reached.  Password reset Password can be reseted with PGP Key added on account (more about PGP below) or with Mnemonic key provided during signup. Mnemonic key is shown only once and should be written down on paper. During signup it is hashed (bcrypt) instantly and only stored in operating memory for the short time during display after which is cleared from memory manually as addition to automatic PHP Garbage Collection.  PGP Each user can add their on PGP key which is used for multiple features. Vendors must have PGP and 2FA enabled before they are allowed to upgrade from user to vendor status. If you have active PGP key you can reset your password with it or enable 2FA for your login. Each PGP key must be confirmed before is linked to account, and if you want to add new key you must first sign a message from the old one. Messages can also be encrypted with user‚Äôs PGP key if its present (this is not enforced, its user‚Äôs choice).  2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)  If user has PGP key linked to their account, they can enable 2FA. If enabled, login to marketplace will be prevented unless randomly generated message is signed from the key.  Wishlist  Buyers do not need to save product links for later. On each product there is ‚ÄúAdd to wishlist‚Äù button that can be used, and they are stored in user‚Äôs personal list for later.  Vendors  Normal users cannot post products on Marketplace. In order to post products you must become vendor. Before you can upgrade you must have PGP key and 2FA Enabled in your profile. Vendor price can be set in marketplace config. Vendor can use any of the coins available to purchase vendor status. Out of each vendor sale, a percentage of sale value goes to marketplace addresses.  Vendor profile customization  Vendors are able to customize their profile with pre-defined profile backgrounds and short personal description.  Vendor levels and XP  Each new vendor starts at Level 0 and progresses further based on performance. XP and Amount of levels is dynamic and configurable. Multipliers determine how much XP is granted to/taken from vendors for each action. XP is granted/taken by formula: USDvalue*multiplier Example: product_delivered multiplier is 20 USD value of product is 100$ When vendor successfully delivers product, he will receive 100*20=2000 XP This is example from experience config file:  Code:  ¬† ¬†‚Äòmultipliers‚Äô => [ ‚Äòproduct_delivered‚Äô => 10, ‚Äòproduct_dispute_lost‚Äô =>20, // How much XP per star (given/taken based on feedback type) ‚Äòfeedback_per_star‚Äô => 2, // how much XP per USD value of transaction (given/taken based on feedback type) ‚Äòfeedback_per_usd‚Äô => 5, ]  Feedback  After each completed purchase, vendors are able to leave feedback. Feedback types are Positive, Neutral and Negative and they will affect vendor score as well as product score.  Multiple Coins  Probably the most important system is Coin System. Its completely dynamic, which means new coins can be added at any time. Standard version of marketplace comes with Bitcoin and Monero included. For each coin added, in marketplace config there can be set unlimited amount of marketplace addresses (used for receiving fees from purchases), and in case more than one address is present, address for receiving fee will be choosen randomly (for each purchase).  Product types There are two product types. Physical and Digital products. Based on the type, different options are displayed during product creating and purchase. Both Digital and Physical products support offers and custom units of measure (Item, kg, gram, piece ‚Ä¶). With offers, vendors can give discounts on purchase based on quantity. For example: Price for 1 product is 100$ Price for 10 products is 90$ Price for 20+ products is 80$ Each of those is considered an offer and can be added/removed at any time.  Digital products support automatic delivery which is optional. If checked, autofill system is used. Each line in textarea is treated as single item and will be product‚Äôs quantity. It will be instantly sent on user upon purchase.  Physical products have delivery options. Each delivery option consists of: Name, Price, Expected delivery duration, Minimum quantity for delivery, Maximum Quantity for delivery. Physical products can also include/exclude countries from shipping.  Markdown styling Instead of just plain text, product description and rules support markdown styling. Every tag is supported except URL tag.  Purchasing  When user chooses to purchase any product, he is able to pay with any coin supported by market (and vendor, since vendors can choose which coins they want on each product). There is no wallets or anything similar. Users do not need to keep money on marketplace at all times. For each purchase random address is generated, and its used for that purchase only.  Escrow  Escrow is present on every purchase by default. Upon purchase, marketplace address is generated that will hold funds. If purchase is completed if its marked as delivered or dispute is resolved. If buyer is unhappy with purchase he can open dispute and potentially (based on admin‚Äôs decision) get his money back. Upon purchase completion, based on result money will be sent from temporary purchase address to buyer/vendor and to one of the marketplace holding addresses.  Cart  If user wants to buy more than one product (maybe from different sellers too), they can add them all in a cart and then checkout only once.  Messages  Most important feature of messages is security. Marketplace uses latest algorithms and standards in Public Key Cryptography¬†(like¬†XChaCha20-Poly1305-IETF)¬†to encrypt messages between users. Upon registration, Public and Private keys are created for each user. Based on user‚Äôs password an encryption key is derived, and that key is used to encrypt Private key, while Public Key is exposed. When user A whats to send message to user B, a key exchange happens. User A encrypts message with User B‚Äôs public key, and that message is stored in database. Only user B can read that message when he logs in and decrypts his messages with password. This system makes messages secure and unreadable by anyone, including marketplace administrator or basically anyone who can possibly get access to the database.  Messages are organized in conversations. Multiple conversations can be started at the same time.  Notifications  Users will get notifications for most actions that happen on marketplace regarding them. Some of the examples are: New message, Purchase status update (product sent, product delivered etc.), Vendor actions (Feedback) and so on. They can be read in User Account Panel and deleted at any time.  Bitmessage  Marketplace can possibly connect to Bitmessage daemon. If connected, users can chose to add their Bitmessage addresses and get their notifications forwarded there. This means they will still get notifications even if they are not currently logged in, and they don‚Äôt need to refresh anything. Before being able to forward notifications, Bitmessage addresses must be confirmed first.  JavaScript Warning  Optional warning can be enabled in marketplace config. If visitor has JavaScript enabled, a message will be displayed notifying them about security issues.  Support  Users can open support tickets regarding any problem they encounter. Administrators/Moderators will see this tickets in admin panel and can reply, or close them.  Admin Panel  Most of the stuff happening on marketplace can be viewed directly on admin panel. Administrators can access every feature on admin panel.  Moderators Modular permission system is currently supported, which means admins can give/take some access to moderators (For example, support staff can only answer tickets and resolve disputes, community manager can only send mass messages etc.). Currently supported features:  Index ‚Äì Basic information  Categories ‚Äì Add/Edit/Remove Categories  Mass Messages ‚Äì Ability to send messages to users by marketplace (Can be filtered to user groups)  Users ‚Äì View users, search, filter, and edit each user individually.  Products ‚Äì View, search, filter by user, or edit product  Log ‚Äì Activity log of all Administrators/Moderators inside Admin Panel Example:  Code:  Bitmessage ‚Äì Status of Bitmessage service (performs test), and view of marketplace bitmessage address  Disputes ‚Äì View and resolve purchase disputes  Tickets ‚Äì View and resolve support tickets  Purchases ‚Äì List of all purchases  Vendor Purchases ‚Äì List of vendor purchases  Supported coins  Marketplace currently supports these coins:  Bitcoin ‚Äì Included in standard version  Monero ‚Äì Included in standard version  Litecoin  DASH  PIVX  Verge  Bitcoin Cash  Installation  Marketplace installation instructions are included.

Support Dashboard Card Payments Quickstart Securely collect card information from your customers and create a card payment.  Supported cards Users in the United States can accept Visa Mastercard American Express Discover JCB Diners Club credit and debit cards.  Stripe also supports a range of additional payment methods, depending on the country of your Stripe account.  Accepting a card payment using Stripe is a two-step process, with a client-side and a server-side action:  From your website running in the customer‚Äôs browser, Stripe securely collects your customer‚Äôs payment information and returns a representative token. This, along with any other form data, is then submitted by the browser to your server. Using the token, your server-side code makes an API request to create a charge and complete the payment. Tokenization ensures that no sensitive card data ever needs to touch your server so your integration can operate in a PCI compliant way.  Step 1: Securely collecting payment information  Checkout reference Complete information about available options and parameters is provided in the Checkout reference.  The simplest way for you to securely collect and tokenize card information is with Checkout. It combines HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to create an embedded payment form. When your customer enters their payment information, the card details are validated and tokenized for your server-side code to use.  To see Checkout in action, click the button below, filling in the resulting form with:  Any random, syntactically valid email address (the more random, the better) One of Stripe‚Äôs test card numbers, such as 4242 4242 4242 4242 Any three-digit CVC code Any expiration date in the future To get started, add the following code to your payment page, making sure that the form submits to your own server-side code:  <form action=""your-server-side-code"" method=""POST"">   <script     src=""https://checkout.stripe.com/checkout.js"" class=""stripe-button""     data-key=""pk_test_2DtHIU1N9li5GpmJjyxkQMHh""     data-amount=""999""     data-name=""Demo Site""     data-description=""Example charge""     data-image=""https://stripe.com/img/documentation/checkout/marketplace.png""     data-locale=""auto"">   </script> </form> We‚Äôve pre-filled the data-key attribute with your test publishable API key‚Äîonly you can see this value. When you‚Äôre ready to go live with your payment form, you must replace the test key with your live key. Learn more about how the keys play into test and live modes.  Although optional, we highly recommend also having Checkout collect the user‚Äôs ZIP code, as address and ZIP code verifications help reduce fraud. Add data-zip-code=""true"" to the above and enable declines on verification failures in your account settings. You can also set Checkout to collect the user‚Äôs full billing and shipping addresses (using the corresponding parameters).  Requiring more than the minimum information lowers the possibility of a payment being declined or disputed in the future. Any fraudulent payments that you process are ultimately your responsibility, so requiring a little more than the minimum amount of information is an effective way to combat fraud.  Radar, our modern suite of fraud protection tools, is only available to users who have implemented client-side tokenization. By doing so, it ensures that you can pass the necessary data required for our machine-learning fraud prevention models to make more accurate predictions.  The amount provided in the Checkout form code is only shown to the user. It does not set the amount that the customer will be charged‚Äîyou must also specify an amount when making a charge request. As you build your integration, make sure that your payment form and server-side code use the same amount to avoid confusion.  An alternative to the blue button demonstrated above is to implement a custom Checkout integration. The custom approach allows you to use any HTML element or JavaScript event to open Checkout, as well as be able to specify dynamic arguments, such as custom amounts.  Stripe.js and Elements If you‚Äôd prefer to have complete control over the look and fel of your payment form, you can make use of Stripe.js and Elements, our pre-built UI components. Refer to our Elements quickstart to learn more.  Mobile SDKs Using our native mobile libraries for iOS and Android, Stripe can collect your customer‚Äôs payment information from within your mobile app and create a token for your server-side code to use.  Step 2: Creating a charge to complete the payment  Once a token is created, your server-side code makes an API request to create a one-time charge. This request contains the token, currency, amount to charge, and any additional information you may want to pass (e.g., metadata).  curl Ruby Python PHP Java Node Go .NET curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges \    -u sk_test_fyzWf8eDyljIob76fMVSwIsi: \    -d amount=999 \    -d currency=usd \    -d description=""Example charge"" \    -d source=tok_6Pk6W3hFiGB7dyNavdvyrFkM These requests expect the ID of the Token (e.g., tok_KPte7942xySKBKyrBu11yEpf) to be provided as the value of the source parameter.  Tokens can only be used once, and within a few minutes of creation. Using this approach, your customers need to re-enter their payment details each time they make a purchase. You can also save card details with Stripe for later use. Using this method, returning customers can quickly make a payment without providing their card details again.  Next steps Congrats! You can now accept card payments with Stripe using Checkout.

1120,blackmarket-script,https://github.com/saffeh6/blackmarket-script.git,"Contact : flokif418@gmail.com  About script  Marketplace v2.0 is also written in PHP with Laravel framework. Its using latest standards for encryption (like Sodium library) and security. Its made without use of JavaScript, so its optimized for TOR, but can also be ran normally like any other web app (as you can see on demo).  ¬†  Requirements  VPS with at least 2GB of RAM  Daemon for each coin that is enabled on marketplace  Server requirements:¬†(what software is needed on VPS)  PHP 7 (recommended and tested on 7.2)  SQL Database (MySQL,PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQL Server)  Elasticsearch (Search interface that will keep track of search records and provide great search performance)  Redis (Optional, but will greatly increase app performance )   ¬†Features  Categories Category system is very dynamic. Categories can be nested indefinitely. Creating, deleting and editing of categories is handled in admin panel.  Detailed home page There is placeholder text on the home page at the moment that will represent most important features of your marketplace. On top of that, all users can see Top Vendors (Vendors with most sales), Latest Orders (Products of orders¬†completed¬†most recently, as well as order value, but no information about buyer or seller), Rising Vendors (Vendors with most sales in specified time frame, defaults to 7 days). Official mirrors is place where you can specify on what other links your website can be reached.  Password reset Password can be reseted with PGP Key added on account (more about PGP below) or with Mnemonic key provided during signup. Mnemonic key is shown only once and should be written down on paper. During signup it is hashed (bcrypt) instantly and only stored in operating memory for the short time during display after which is cleared from memory manually as addition to automatic PHP Garbage Collection.  PGP Each user can add their on PGP key which is used for multiple features. Vendors must have PGP and 2FA enabled before they are allowed to upgrade from user to vendor status. If you have active PGP key you can reset your password with it or enable 2FA for your login. Each PGP key must be confirmed before is linked to account, and if you want to add new key you must first sign a message from the old one. Messages can also be encrypted with user‚Äôs PGP key if its present (this is not enforced, its user‚Äôs choice).  2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)  If user has PGP key linked to their account, they can enable 2FA. If enabled, login to marketplace will be prevented unless randomly generated message is signed from the key.  Wishlist  Buyers do not need to save product links for later. On each product there is ‚ÄúAdd to wishlist‚Äù button that can be used, and they are stored in user‚Äôs personal list for later.  Vendors  Normal users cannot post products on Marketplace. In order to post products you must become vendor. Before you can upgrade you must have PGP key and 2FA Enabled in your profile. Vendor price can be set in marketplace config. Vendor can use any of the coins available to purchase vendor status. Out of each vendor sale, a percentage of sale value goes to marketplace addresses.  Vendor profile customization  Vendors are able to customize their profile with pre-defined profile backgrounds and short personal description.  Vendor levels and XP  Each new vendor starts at Level 0 and progresses further based on performance. XP and Amount of levels is dynamic and configurable. Multipliers determine how much XP is granted to/taken from vendors for each action. XP is granted/taken by formula: USDvalue*multiplier Example: product_delivered multiplier is 20 USD value of product is 100$ When vendor successfully delivers product, he will receive 100*20=2000 XP This is example from experience config file:  Code:  ¬† ¬†‚Äòmultipliers‚Äô => [ ‚Äòproduct_delivered‚Äô => 10, ‚Äòproduct_dispute_lost‚Äô =>20, // How much XP per star (given/taken based on feedback type) ‚Äòfeedback_per_star‚Äô => 2, // how much XP per USD value of transaction (given/taken based on feedback type) ‚Äòfeedback_per_usd‚Äô => 5, ]  Feedback  After each completed purchase, vendors are able to leave feedback. Feedback types are Positive, Neutral and Negative and they will affect vendor score as well as product score.  Multiple Coins  Probably the most important system is Coin System. Its completely dynamic, which means new coins can be added at any time. Standard version of marketplace comes with Bitcoin and Monero included. For each coin added, in marketplace config there can be set unlimited amount of marketplace addresses (used for receiving fees from purchases), and in case more than one address is present, address for receiving fee will be choosen randomly (for each purchase).  Product types There are two product types. Physical and Digital products. Based on the type, different options are displayed during product creating and purchase. Both Digital and Physical products support offers and custom units of measure (Item, kg, gram, piece ‚Ä¶). With offers, vendors can give discounts on purchase based on quantity. For example: Price for 1 product is 100$ Price for 10 products is 90$ Price for 20+ products is 80$ Each of those is considered an offer and can be added/removed at any time.  Digital products support automatic delivery which is optional. If checked, autofill system is used. Each line in textarea is treated as single item and will be product‚Äôs quantity. It will be instantly sent on user upon purchase.  Physical products have delivery options. Each delivery option consists of: Name, Price, Expected delivery duration, Minimum quantity for delivery, Maximum Quantity for delivery. Physical products can also include/exclude countries from shipping.  Markdown styling Instead of just plain text, product description and rules support markdown styling. Every tag is supported except URL tag.  Purchasing  When user chooses to purchase any product, he is able to pay with any coin supported by market (and vendor, since vendors can choose which coins they want on each product). There is no wallets or anything similar. Users do not need to keep money on marketplace at all times. For each purchase random address is generated, and its used for that purchase only.  Escrow  Escrow is present on every purchase by default. Upon purchase, marketplace address is generated that will hold funds. If purchase is completed if its marked as delivered or dispute is resolved. If buyer is unhappy with purchase he can open dispute and potentially (based on admin‚Äôs decision) get his money back. Upon purchase completion, based on result money will be sent from temporary purchase address to buyer/vendor and to one of the marketplace holding addresses.  Cart  If user wants to buy more than one product (maybe from different sellers too), they can add them all in a cart and then checkout only once.  Messages  Most important feature of messages is security. Marketplace uses latest algorithms and standards in Public Key Cryptography¬†(like¬†XChaCha20-Poly1305-IETF)¬†to encrypt messages between users. Upon registration, Public and Private keys are created for each user. Based on user‚Äôs password an encryption key is derived, and that key is used to encrypt Private key, while Public Key is exposed. When user A whats to send message to user B, a key exchange happens. User A encrypts message with User B‚Äôs public key, and that message is stored in database. Only user B can read that message when he logs in and decrypts his messages with password. This system makes messages secure and unreadable by anyone, including marketplace administrator or basically anyone who can possibly get access to the database.  Messages are organized in conversations. Multiple conversations can be started at the same time.  Notifications  Users will get notifications for most actions that happen on marketplace regarding them. Some of the examples are: New message, Purchase status update (product sent, product delivered etc.), Vendor actions (Feedback) and so on. They can be read in User Account Panel and deleted at any time.  Bitmessage  Marketplace can possibly connect to Bitmessage daemon. If connected, users can chose to add their Bitmessage addresses and get their notifications forwarded there. This means they will still get notifications even if they are not currently logged in, and they don‚Äôt need to refresh anything. Before being able to forward notifications, Bitmessage addresses must be confirmed first.  JavaScript Warning  Optional warning can be enabled in marketplace config. If visitor has JavaScript enabled, a message will be displayed notifying them about security issues.  Support  Users can open support tickets regarding any problem they encounter. Administrators/Moderators will see this tickets in admin panel and can reply, or close them.  Admin Panel  Most of the stuff happening on marketplace can be viewed directly on admin panel. Administrators can access every feature on admin panel.  Moderators Modular permission system is currently supported, which means admins can give/take some access to moderators (For example, support staff can only answer tickets and resolve disputes, community manager can only send mass messages etc.). Currently supported features:  Index ‚Äì Basic information  Categories ‚Äì Add/Edit/Remove Categories  Mass Messages ‚Äì Ability to send messages to users by marketplace (Can be filtered to user groups)  Users ‚Äì View users, search, filter, and edit each user individually.  Products ‚Äì View, search, filter by user, or edit product  Log ‚Äì Activity log of all Administrators/Moderators inside Admin Panel Example:  Code:  Bitmessage ‚Äì Status of Bitmessage service (performs test), and view of marketplace bitmessage address  Disputes ‚Äì View and resolve purchase disputes  Tickets ‚Äì View and resolve support tickets  Purchases ‚Äì List of all purchases  Vendor Purchases ‚Äì List of vendor purchases  Supported coins  Marketplace currently supports these coins:  Bitcoin ‚Äì Included in standard version  Monero ‚Äì Included in standard version  Litecoin  DASH  PIVX  Verge  Bitcoin Cash  Installation  Marketplace installation instructions are included. These are not 100% copy paste but they do explain how must of the things work in detail.  Selling terms and conditions:  I‚Äôm selling only script, I won‚Äôt help you install it,or whatever you want to do after you purchase it  I‚Äôm not responsible for anything you do with the files after the purchase  After purchase you cannot resell or share this script  Script is tested for bugs but In case you find any, or any error in code it will be fixed with no additional charge  I will not give you files first in any case.

1338,blockchain-technology,https://github.com/andrewmogbolu2/blockchain-technology.git,"Blockchain and AI are on just about every chief information officers watchlist of game-changing technologies that stand to reshape industries. Both technologies come with immense benefits, but both also bring their own challenges for adoption. It is also fair to say that the hype surrounding these technologies individually may be unprecedented, so the thought of bringing these two ingredients together may be viewed by some as brewing a modern-day version of IT pixie dust. At the same time, there is a logical way to think about this mash-up that is both sensible and pragmatic.  Today, AI is for all intents and purposes a centralized process. An end user must have extreme faith in the central authority to produce a trusted business outcome. By decentralizing the three key elements of AI ‚Äî that is, data, models, and analytics ‚Äî blockchain can deliver the trust and confidence often needed for end users to fully adopt and rely on AI-based business processes. Let‚Äôs explore how blockchain is poised to enrich AI by bringing trust to data, models and analytics.  Your data is your data Many of the world‚Äôs most notable AI technology services are centralized ‚Äî including Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, as well as Chinese companies Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent. Yet all have encountered challenges in establishing trust among their eager, but somewhat cautious users. How can a business provide assurance to its users that its AI has not overstepped its bounds?  Imagine if these AI services could produce a ‚Äúforensic report,‚Äù verified by a third party, to prove to you, beyond a reasonable doubt, how and when businesses are using your data once those are ingested. Imagine further that your data could be used only if you gave permission to do so.  A blockchain ledger can be used as a digital rights management system, allowing your data to be ‚Äúlicensed‚Äù to the AI provider under your terms, conditions and duration. The ledger would act as an access management system storing the proofs and permission by which a business can access and use the user‚Äôs data.  Trusted AI models Consider the example of using blockchain technology as a means of providing trusted data and provenance of training models for machine learning. In this case, we‚Äôve created a fictitious system to answer the question of whether a fruit is an apple or orange.  This question-answering system that we build is called a model, and this model is created via a process called training. The goal of training is to create an accurate model that answers our questions correctly most of the time. Of course, to train a model, we need to collect data to train on ‚Äî for this example, that could be the color of the fruit (as a wavelength of light) and the sugar content (as a percentage).  With blockchain, you can track the provenance of the training data as well as see an audit trail of the evidence that led to the prediction of why a particular fruit is considered an apple versus an orange. A business can also prove that it is not ‚Äújuicing up‚Äù its books by tagging fruit more often as apples, if that is the more expensive of the two fruits.  Explaining AI decisions The European Union has adopted a law requiring that any decision made by a machine be readily explainable, on penalty of fines that could cost companies billions of dollars. The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into force in 2018, includes a right to obtain an explanation of decisions made by algorithms and a right to opt out of some algorithmic decisions altogether.  Massive amounts of data are being produced every second ‚Äî more data than humans have the ability to assess and use as the basis for drawing conclusions. However, AI applications are capable of assessing large data sets and many variables, while learning about or connecting those variables relevant to its tasks and objectives. For this very reason, AI continues to be adopted in various industries and applications, and we are relying more and more on their outcomes. It is essential, however, that any decisions made by AI are still verified for accuracy by humans.  Blockchain can help clarify the provenance, transparency, understanding, and explanations of those outcomes and decisions. If decisions and associated data points are recorded via transactions on a blockchain, the inherent attributes of blockchain will make auditing them much simpler. Blockchain is a key technology that brings trust to transactions in a network; therefore, infusing blockchain into AI decision-making processes could be the element needed to achieve the transparency necessary to fully trust the decisions and outcomes derived from AI.  Blockchain and the Internet of Things More than a billion intelligent, connected devices are already part of today‚Äôs IoT. The expected proliferation of hundreds of billions more places us at the threshold of a transformation sweeping across the electronics industry and many other areas.  With the advancement in IoT, industries are now enabled to capture data, gain insight from the data, and make decisions based on the data. Therefore, there is a lot of ‚Äútrust‚Äù in the information obtained. But the real truth of the matter is, do we really know where these data came from and should we be making decisions and transacting based on data we cannot validate?  For example, did weather data really originate from a censor in the Atlantic Ocean or did the shipping container really not exceed the agreed temperature limit? The IoT use cases are massive, but they all share the same issue with trust.  IoT with blockchain can bring real trust to captured data. The underlying idea is to give devices, at the time of their creation, an identity that can be validated and verified throughout their lifecycle with blockchain. There is great potential for IoT systems in blockchain technology capabilities that rely on device identity protocols and reputation systems. With a device identity protocol, each device can have its own blockchain public key and send encrypted challenge and response messages to other devices, thereby ensuring a device remains in control of its identity. In addition, a device with an identity can develop a reputation or history that is tracked by a blockchain.  Smart contracts represent the business logic of a blockchain network. When a transaction is proposed, these smart contracts are autonomously executed within the guidelines set by the network. In IoT networks, smart contracts can play a pivotal role by providing automated coordination and authorization for transactions and interactions. The original idea behind IoT was to surface data and gain actionable insight at the right time.  For example, smart homes are a thing of the present and most everything can be connected. In fact, with IoT, when something goes wrong, these IoT devices can even take action ‚Äî for example, ordering a new part. We need a way to govern the actions taken by these devices, and smart contracts are a great way to do so.  In an ongoing experiment I have followed in Brooklyn, New York, a community is using a blockchain to record the production of solar energy and enable the purchase of excess renewable energy credits. The device itself has an identity and builds a reputation through its history of records and exchange. Through the blockchain, people can aggregate their purchasing power more easily, share the burden of maintenance, and trust that devices are recording actual solar production.  As IoT continues to evolve and its adoption continues to grow, the ability to autonomously manage devices and actions taken by devices will be essential. Blockchain and smart contracts are positioned well to integrate those capabilities into IoT.",2,1,2,shipping,GitHub
