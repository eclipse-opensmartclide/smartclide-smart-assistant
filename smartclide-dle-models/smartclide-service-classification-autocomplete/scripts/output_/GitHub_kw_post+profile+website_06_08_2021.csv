See ""[Differences between GitHub Apps and OAuth Apps](/apps/differences-between-apps/)"" for more details. - Apps should use the principle of least privilege and should only request the OAuth scopes and GitHub App permissions that the app needs to perform its intended functionality. For more information, see [Principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) in Wikipedia. - Apps should provide customers with a way to delete their account, without having to email or call a support person. - Apps should not share tokens between different implementations of the app. For example, a desktop app should have a separate token from a web-based app. Individual tokens allow each app to request the access needed for GitHub resources separately. - Design your app with different user roles, depending on the functionality needed by each type of user. For example, a standard user should not have access to admin functionality, and billing managers might not need push access to repository code. - Apps should not share service accounts such as email or database services to manage your SaaS service. - All services used in your app should have unique login and password credentials. - Admin privilege access to the production hosting infrastructure should only be given to engineers and employees with administrative duties. - Apps should not use personal access tokens to authenticate and should authenticate as an [OAuth App](/apps/about-apps/#about-oauth-apps) or a [GitHub App](/apps/about-apps/#about-github-apps):   - OAuth Apps should authenticate using an [OAuth token](/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps/).   - GitHub Apps should authenticate using either a [JSON Web Token (JWT)](/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps/#authenticating-as-a-github-app), [OAuth token](/apps/building-github-apps/identifying-and-authorizing-users-for-github-apps/), or [installation access token](/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps/#authenticating-as-an-installation).  ### Data protection  - Apps should encrypt data transferred over the public internet using HTTPS, with a valid TLS certificate, or SSH for Git. - Apps should store client ID and client secret keys securely. We recommend storing them as [environmental variables](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable#Getting_and_setting_environment_variables). - Apps should delete all GitHub user data within 30 days of receiving a request from the user, or within 30 days of the end of the user's legal relationship with GitHub. - Apps should not require the user to provide their GitHub password. - Apps should encrypt tokens, client IDs, and client secrets.  ### Logging and monitoring  Apps should have logging and monitoring capabilities. App logs should be retained for at least 30 days and archived for at least one year. A security log should include:  - Authentication and authorization events - Service configuration changes - Object reads and writes - All user and group permission changes - Elevation of role to admin - Consistent timestamping for each event - Source users, IP addresses, and/or hostnames for all logged actions  ### Incident response workflow  To provide a secure experience for users, you should have a clear incident response plan in place before listing your app. We recommend having a security and operations incident response team in your company rather than using a third-party vendor. You should have the capability to notify {% data variables.product.product_name %} within 24 hours of a confirmed incident.  For an example of an incident response workflow, see the ""Data Breach Response Policy"" on the [SANS Institute website](https://www.sans.org/information-security-policy/). A short document with clear steps to take in the event of an incident is more valuable than a lengthy policy template.  ### Vulnerability management and patching workflow  You should conduct regular vulnerability scans of production infrastructure. You should triage the results of vulnerability scans and define a period of time in which you agree to remediate the vulnerability.  If you are not ready to set up a full vulnerability management program, it's useful to start by creating a patching process.

Discussions are for conversations that need to be transparent and accessible but do not need to be tracked on a project board and are not related to code, unlike issues. Discussions enable fluid, open conversation in a public forum.

9,blackmarket-script,https://github.com/saffeh6/blackmarket-script.git,"Contact : flokif418@gmail.com  About script  Marketplace v2.0 is also written in PHP with Laravel framework. Its using latest standards for encryption (like Sodium library) and security. Its made without use of JavaScript, so its optimized for TOR, but can also be ran normally like any other web app (as you can see on demo).     Requirements  VPS with at least 2GB of RAM  Daemon for each coin that is enabled on marketplace  Server requirements: (what software is needed on VPS)  PHP 7 (recommended and tested on 7.2)  SQL Database (MySQL,PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQL Server)  Elasticsearch (Search interface that will keep track of search records and provide great search performance)  Redis (Optional, but will greatly increase app performance )    Features  Categories Category system is very dynamic. Categories can be nested indefinitely. Creating, deleting and editing of categories is handled in admin panel.  Detailed home page There is placeholder text on the home page at the moment that will represent most important features of your marketplace. On top of that, all users can see Top Vendors (Vendors with most sales), Latest Orders (Products of orders completed most recently, as well as order value, but no information about buyer or seller), Rising Vendors (Vendors with most sales in specified time frame, defaults to 7 days). Official mirrors is place where you can specify on what other links your website can be reached.  Password reset Password can be reseted with PGP Key added on account (more about PGP below) or with Mnemonic key provided during signup. Mnemonic key is shown only once and should be written down on paper. During signup it is hashed (bcrypt) instantly and only stored in operating memory for the short time during display after which is cleared from memory manually as addition to automatic PHP Garbage Collection.  PGP Each user can add their on PGP key which is used for multiple features. Vendors must have PGP and 2FA enabled before they are allowed to upgrade from user to vendor status. If you have active PGP key you can reset your password with it or enable 2FA for your login. Each PGP key must be confirmed before is linked to account, and if you want to add new key you must first sign a message from the old one. Messages can also be encrypted with user’s PGP key if its present (this is not enforced, its user’s choice).  2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)  If user has PGP key linked to their account, they can enable 2FA. If enabled, login to marketplace will be prevented unless randomly generated message is signed from the key.  Wishlist  Buyers do not need to save product links for later. On each product there is “Add to wishlist” button that can be used, and they are stored in user’s personal list for later.  Vendors  Normal users cannot post products on Marketplace. In order to post products you must become vendor. Before you can upgrade you must have PGP key and 2FA Enabled in your profile. Vendor price can be set in marketplace config. Vendor can use any of the coins available to purchase vendor status. Out of each vendor sale, a percentage of sale value goes to marketplace addresses.  Vendor profile customization  Vendors are able to customize their profile with pre-defined profile backgrounds and short personal description.  Vendor levels and XP  Each new vendor starts at Level 0 and progresses further based on performance. XP and Amount of levels is dynamic and configurable. Multipliers determine how much XP is granted to/taken from vendors for each action. XP is granted/taken by formula: USDvalue*multiplier Example: product_delivered multiplier is 20 USD value of product is 100$ When vendor successfully delivers product, he will receive 100*20=2000 XP This is example from experience config file:  Code:     ‘multipliers’ => [ ‘product_delivered’ => 10, ‘product_dispute_lost’ =>20, // How much XP per star (given/taken based on feedback type) ‘feedback_per_star’ => 2, // how much XP per USD value of transaction (given/taken based on feedback type) ‘feedback_per_usd’ => 5, ]  Feedback  After each completed purchase, vendors are able to leave feedback. Feedback types are Positive, Neutral and Negative and they will affect vendor score as well as product score.  Multiple Coins  Probably the most important system is Coin System. Its completely dynamic, which means new coins can be added at any time. Standard version of marketplace comes with Bitcoin and Monero included. For each coin added, in marketplace config there can be set unlimited amount of marketplace addresses (used for receiving fees from purchases), and in case more than one address is present, address for receiving fee will be choosen randomly (for each purchase).  Product types There are two product types. Physical and Digital products. Based on the type, different options are displayed during product creating and purchase. Both Digital and Physical products support offers and custom units of measure (Item, kg, gram, piece …). With offers, vendors can give discounts on purchase based on quantity. For example: Price for 1 product is 100$ Price for 10 products is 90$ Price for 20+ products is 80$ Each of those is considered an offer and can be added/removed at any time.  Digital products support automatic delivery which is optional. If checked, autofill system is used. Each line in textarea is treated as single item and will be product’s quantity. It will be instantly sent on user upon purchase.  Physical products have delivery options. Each delivery option consists of: Name, Price, Expected delivery duration, Minimum quantity for delivery, Maximum Quantity for delivery. Physical products can also include/exclude countries from shipping.  Markdown styling Instead of just plain text, product description and rules support markdown styling. Every tag is supported except URL tag.  Purchasing  When user chooses to purchase any product, he is able to pay with any coin supported by market (and vendor, since vendors can choose which coins they want on each product). There is no wallets or anything similar. Users do not need to keep money on marketplace at all times. For each purchase random address is generated, and its used for that purchase only.  Escrow  Escrow is present on every purchase by default. Upon purchase, marketplace address is generated that will hold funds. If purchase is completed if its marked as delivered or dispute is resolved. If buyer is unhappy with purchase he can open dispute and potentially (based on admin’s decision) get his money back. Upon purchase completion, based on result money will be sent from temporary purchase address to buyer/vendor and to one of the marketplace holding addresses.  Cart  If user wants to buy more than one product (maybe from different sellers too), they can add them all in a cart and then checkout only once.  Messages  Most important feature of messages is security. Marketplace uses latest algorithms and standards in Public Key Cryptography (like XChaCha20-Poly1305-IETF) to encrypt messages between users. Upon registration, Public and Private keys are created for each user. Based on user’s password an encryption key is derived, and that key is used to encrypt Private key, while Public Key is exposed. When user A whats to send message to user B, a key exchange happens. User A encrypts message with User B’s public key, and that message is stored in database. Only user B can read that message when he logs in and decrypts his messages with password. This system makes messages secure and unreadable by anyone, including marketplace administrator or basically anyone who can possibly get access to the database.  Messages are organized in conversations. Multiple conversations can be started at the same time.  Notifications  Users will get notifications for most actions that happen on marketplace regarding them. Some of the examples are: New message, Purchase status update (product sent, product delivered etc.), Vendor actions (Feedback) and so on. They can be read in User Account Panel and deleted at any time.  Bitmessage  Marketplace can possibly connect to Bitmessage daemon. If connected, users can chose to add their Bitmessage addresses and get their notifications forwarded there. This means they will still get notifications even if they are not currently logged in, and they don’t need to refresh anything. Before being able to forward notifications, Bitmessage addresses must be confirmed first.  JavaScript Warning  Optional warning can be enabled in marketplace config. If visitor has JavaScript enabled, a message will be displayed notifying them about security issues.  Support  Users can open support tickets regarding any problem they encounter. Administrators/Moderators will see this tickets in admin panel and can reply, or close them.  Admin Panel  Most of the stuff happening on marketplace can be viewed directly on admin panel. Administrators can access every feature on admin panel.  Moderators Modular permission system is currently supported, which means admins can give/take some access to moderators (For example, support staff can only answer tickets and resolve disputes, community manager can only send mass messages etc.). Currently supported features:  Index – Basic information  Categories – Add/Edit/Remove Categories  Mass Messages – Ability to send messages to users by marketplace (Can be filtered to user groups)  Users – View users, search, filter, and edit each user individually.  Products – View, search, filter by user, or edit product  Log – Activity log of all Administrators/Moderators inside Admin Panel Example:  Code:  Bitmessage – Status of Bitmessage service (performs test), and view of marketplace bitmessage address  Disputes – View and resolve purchase disputes  Tickets – View and resolve support tickets  Purchases – List of all purchases  Vendor Purchases – List of vendor purchases  Supported coins  Marketplace currently supports these coins:  Bitcoin – Included in standard version  Monero – Included in standard version  Litecoin  DASH  PIVX  Verge  Bitcoin Cash  Installation  Marketplace installation instructions are included. These are not 100% copy paste but they do explain how must of the things work in detail.  Selling terms and conditions:  I’m selling only script, I won’t help you install it,or whatever you want to do after you purchase it  I’m not responsible for anything you do with the files after the purchase  After purchase you cannot resell or share this script  Script is tested for bugs but In case you find any, or any error in code it will be fixed with no additional charge  I will not give you files first in any case.

P2P lending websites provide a platform that directly connects borrowers to investors. For lenders, P2P lending is a way to generate income on their cash at a rate that exceeds those offered by conventional savings accounts. The loan applicant posts a financial profile that is assigned a risk category that determines the interest rate the applicant will pay. Most P2P lending sites have a wide range of interest rates based on the creditworthiness of the applicant. The rates for applicants with good credit are often lower than comparable bank rates, while rates for applicants with sketchy credit records may go much higher. However, the default rates of P2P lending make it an interesting case to study and ponder whether the returns are worth the risk.",0,0,0,post+profile+website,GitHub

179,Charity,https://github.com/OlegCerkas/Charity.git," Uniting good people & good causes – Understanding Do Forward  A new way of charity and donation is born. With this platform we believe that now everyone can be a part of doing well for the society in a way or two. We wanted everyone in the society to be good and everyone to do good for others.  “The heart that gives, gathers.” – Tao Te Ching  This was our motivation to bring something like Do Forward website. We’d like to call it a medium rather than a website.  What is Do Forward? What this medium is.  Do Forward as the name suggests, we wanted to encourage people and make them understand the meaning of “giving”. Because we all know that no one has ever become poor by giving.  So we came up with an idea of such platform where people can “forward the gifts to the other hands that need them.” So this is actually Do Forward. Gift is something we call the things or items you have already and you are forwarding to another hand without any cost and all by your heart.  So, Do Forward is actually a community website or platform wherein people can find people to give gifts or receive gifts and all free of cost. In this way one can bring more meaning to their life and promote generosity.  Let’s take a look at the short walk through of this medium & experience more pleasure. We actually built this website with heart.  Getting Started  Be a donor and a volunteer at a same time On Do Forward, you could be both “a donor” and “a volunteer” at the same time. Just make a sign up, complete your profile and upload a profile pic. You are all set to become a part of something good.  For all the activities you do on the Do Forward platform, you earn Karma Points.  And with your increasing Karma points your karma level increases.  Knowing Karma Points & Levels  With every activities you don on the website, your points increase and we call these points as “Karma Points”. It starts right from your sign up. Yes you get 50 Karma Points on the sign up itself and you are at the Level 1 i.e. Greenie.  There are 6 Karma Levels as follows: 1. Level 1 – Greenie  2. Level 2 – Trendsetter  3. Level 3 – Philanthropist  4. Level 4 – Visionary  5. Level 5 – Luminary  6. Level 6 – Enlightened  With your increasing Karma Points you will cross these levels. Get the detailed information of earning Karma points here.  Karma Meter With Karma meter you can also track your current level and how much to reach the next level from your profile page.  Post Gift and Give to them who need it  On Do Forward medium you can be a donor allowing you to make your items or things donated to someone who needs it. We call them “Gifts”  You can post gift, with all the details and photos of the gift. Post it and tell about your gift in detail. What’s next?  Get applications from different people (you will receive mail of the applicant with all the contact details as filled by the applicant while making application)  Choose the applicant you want to give away the gift  Discuss mutually and set up the delivery of the gift  Once you deliver the gift to the selected applicant, the applicant has to confirm the gift being received under “Activities” tab in user menu.  Once the applicant confirms the gift being received, the donor (you) gets point and is added to your profile.  Browse gift and get yourself a gift  On Do Forward medium you will find a range of gifts from household things to office stuffs or personal usable things. All you need is to browse our list of gifts and apply with your contact details, for the one you like or need it.  Once you apply for the gift, you shall be able to see the donor’s contact number.  Once the donor confirms to give the gift to you, you shall get the mail.  Discuss mutually about the sending and receiving of the gift.  Once you receive the gift, go to “My Activities” page and confirm the gift being received under “My Gift Status” with a Yes/No.  On successful gift being received, the donor get the point.  Post your cause to find volunteers for your cause and events  On this medium, you can also find some helping hands for your events or charity causes. Yes, you can find the volunteers and social workers right from Do Forward.  How it works? Post Cause. Post you event details and images and tell everything in brief about the event with the number of volunteers required.  Browse & Finalize Volunteer Profile. View all the applicants’ profiles and choose the right one for your event.  View your volunteer list. You can see all you finalized volunteers under the “Attendees” list.  After you successful event, you can confirm the presence of your selected volunteers. On your confirmation, the volunteers shall earn the points as per the number of hours served at the event or causes.  Plus, you being a host of the event get points too.  Becoming a volunteer for your nearby events  So what can you do to help people (or animals) who need it? The answer is — volunteer!  Volunteering for a good cause make a real difference to the life. You are becoming a part of something good. Join and volunteer for as many events such as fundraisers, social cause, helping children, helping old people, orphanage, etc. It feels good when you know that you are making a difference in many lives including yours. Let some of your free time be spent helping others.  How can you be a volunteer? Or how can I apply for any cause? On Do Forward you will find different types of volunteering causes. Choose the right one and apply for the one you feel the perfect fit for.  On you application to be a volunteer for an event, the organizer has to confirm by accepting the application. Once the organizer confirms your application you shall be notified for being chose. You shall get the mail with all the details.  Make sure, you be present in the event at right time. Because your presence matters a lot in helping your karma points grow. Only if the organizer confirms your presence in the event from the Do Forward medium, you shall get the points for volunteering the event for the number of hours mentioned.  In this way, you for being a volunteer and organizer both gets points.  Whether you are a donor of the gift or the applicant of the gift; whether you are an organizer of an event or a volunteer for an event, you can track all your activities under one single page “Activities”.  Isn’t it interesting? We know it is. So what are you waiting for? We believe that you can make a difference in the world and spread happiness.

When Hashing power buyer submits an order for purchasing of the Hashing power via NiceHash Platform or via the NiceHash API he authorizes NiceHash to execute the order on his behalf and for his account in accordance with such order. Hashing power buyer acknowledges and agrees that NiceHash is not acting as his broker, intermediary, agent or advisor or in any fiduciary capacity. NiceHash executes the order in set order amount minus NiceHash’s processing fee. Once the order is successfully submitted the order amount starts to decrease in real time according to the payments for the provided hashing power.  Hashing power buyer agrees to pay applicable processing fee to NiceHash for provided services. The NiceHash’s fees are deducted from Hashing power buyer’s NiceHash Wallet once the whole order is exhausted and completed. Please refer to the NiceHash Platform, for more information about the fees which are applicable at the time of provision of services. NiceHash reserves the right to change these fees according to the provisions to change these Terms at any time for any reason. The changed fees will apply only for the NiceHash Services provided after the change of the fees. All orders submitted prior the fee change but not necessary completed prior the fee change will be charged according to the fees applicable at the time of the submission of the order.  NiceHash will attempt, on a commercially reasonable basis, to execute the Hashing power buyer’s purchase of the hashing power on the Hashing power marketplace under these Terms according to the best-effort delivery approach. In this respect NiceHash does not guarantee that the hashing power will actually be delivered or verified and does not guarantee any quality of the NiceHash Services.  Hashing power buyer may cancel a submitted order during order’s lifetime. If an order has been partially executed, Hashing power buyer may cancel the unexecuted remainder of the order. In this case the NiceHash’s processing fee will apply only for the partially executed order. NiceHash reserves the right to refuse any order cancellation request once the order has been submitted.
