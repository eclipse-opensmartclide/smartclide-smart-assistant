If that particular paper is lost because of some reasons so our scoreboard is also lost. So we have developed a web application for updating live scores and constructed a website to view Live Scores.  There have been several tries at predicting sport games using data from the past, but humans are still superior at predicting sport outcomes. There are multiple commercial services which have sports analysis and prediction as their main business. They use “sophisticated software and statistical algorithms” to aid their data tracking, but at the core they still have experts analysing the games manually. In the present article, we proposed the system to provide a switch section for the live updated scores of Events. We use the API of Live Score for matches. System shows the live score for all matches. This system is implemented by using php and mysql apache server for client server communication.  This system is designed to minimize the Volunteer effort for maintaining a Scoreboard. As the Updating Scoreboard process is done without any human interference, which is the main scope in the system, the aim is completed.",1,0,1,statistic+sport,GitHub
6,Prediction-of-Atheletes-Performance,https://github.com/Adithya1832002/Prediction-of-Atheletes-Performance.git,"Predicting-Athlete-Performance An athlete performance can be determined by many factors such as height, age, and weight. Hence, we analyse which of these factors affect the performance of the athlete the most. Here we use statistical methods like correlation, regression and hypothesis testing. This project helps us to predict the chance of winning in the Olympic games and also helps to choose the most appropriate one among all the athletes by a country for the Olympic games.  METHODOLOGY  We use R language and MS Excel for this project. First using MS Excel, we filtered our dataset which contained unwanted data’s like name, nationality, year. In R, we have stored the data of each sport in an index of a list. Then we get input from the user to select the sports we want to know about. After the sports is selected by the user, the p value is checked for the variables. Further analysis can be done only if the p-value is lesser than 0.5. This ensures that there is a strong relationship between the variables and further analysis carried out will be correct. Next we plot correlation matrix and scatter plot to know the relation between medals and age, height and weight. Then finally we find the regression equation so the end user can simply give in age, height and weight inputs and can select the highest value for medal.  TECHNIQUES USED IN STATISTICS:  Correlation Regression P-value FUNCTIONS USED IN R:  pairs.panel() lm() summary() Correlation: Correlation is a statistical technique that can show whether and how strongly pairs of variables are related. For example, height and weight are related; taller people tend to be heavier than shorter people. Like all statistical techniques, correlation is only appropriate for certain kinds of data. Correlation works for quantifiable data in which numbers are meaningful, usually quantities of some sort. It cannot be used for purely categorical data, such as gender, brands purchased, or favourite colour. The correlation coefficient that indicates the strength of the relationship between two variables can be found using the following formula:  Where: • rxy – the correlation coefficient of the linear relationship between the variables x and y • xi – the values of the x-variable in a sample • x̅ – the mean of the values of the x-variable • yi – the values of the y-variable in a sample • ȳ – the mean of the values of the y-variable  Regression: In statistical modelling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable (often called the 'outcome variable') and one or more independent variables (often called 'predictors', 'covariates', or 'features'). The most common form of regression analysis is linear regression, in which a researcher finds the line (or a more complex linear function) that most closely fits the data according to a specific mathematical criterion.  Multiple linear regression analysis is essentially similar to the simple linear model, with the exception that multiple independent variables are used in the model. The mathematical representation of multiple linear regression is: Y = a + bX1 + cX2 + dX3 + ϵ  Where: • b, c, d – slopes • Y – dependent variable • X1, X2, X3 – independent (explanatory) variables • a – intercept • ϵ – residual (error)  P-Values: The p-value for each term tests the null hypothesis that the coefficient is equal to zero (no effect). A low p-value (< 0.05) indicates that you can reject the null hypothesis. In other words, a predictor that has a low p-value is likely to be a meaningful addition to your model because changes in the predictor's value are related to changes in the response variable. Conversely, a larger (insignificant) p-value suggests that changes in the predictor are not associated with changes in the response. The variables used in this test are: • Dependent variable : Medal • Independent variable : Age, Height and Weight  How to Run Download the code.R file and the dataset (Extract the athlete_events.rar) to the same directory.  Run the first line of the code seperately i.e., Give the input seperately. For example, Enter the sport : Taekwondo  After giving the input, run the remaining lines of the code.",1,0,1,statistic+sport,GitHub

If you play sports this world - welcome to the world of sports prediction and betting winnings. useful basic tools for sporting events are quite simple, but using them regularly, you can develop your own strategy for success and increase your income. On the eve of Euro 2016, the most ardent fans of sports games are activated after the Champions League and are preparing to get a dose of adrenaline not only watch games on TV, but also develop their own principle to predict the growth of victory in sports competitions. So, the most important thing: we recommend you make a conscious bet in this sport, which is closer to you, and find out where you are aimed at the best. The most popular types of sports events are betting hockey, basketball, tennis and football. After that, when you have chosen certain sports can go to the choice of games that will distribute the bet. This is clear and corresponds to the compliance rate. There are various kinds of factors: decimal, fractional and American factors. For more impressive victories, you must select games with a higher odds of 1.5 and put in these games. Then we turn to the theory of probabilistic forecasts of sports. The odds of winning will be more apparent after calculating the percentage chance of winning the respective team. To choose the best ratio between the bookmakers do the analysis and determine the speed. At this stage, we must correctly determine the type of speed that we want to do. This can be as simple and intuitive betting ""1x2 result"" can be podstrahovuyuschaya speed ""double result"", ""half match"", ""Total"" or ""Total Asia"" and ""accurate calculation"", ""disability"" or ""Asian handicap"", which some bookmakers are also listed as a kind of ""odds"". The main thing at this stage is the correct distribution of the bank. To increase the rate of return, we do not recommend putting all eggs in one basket, and a crowd of about 10 percent of the bank for each of the tariffs. In total, we make statistical analysis and information based on the opinions of three parts: in the bookmaker office, users and experts. Expert kidnappers and confident understanding of the fact that the game is a game. And you should always be aware of the fact that it plays an important role in percentage guessing. Any bet is a guessing. Formally, there is always a favorite, but almost all the chances are 50 to 50. And to be on the crest of a wave of sports and be successful, and most importantly, profit in sports betting and forecasts is a watch for momentum, and every day to view forecasts. You can view a series of predictions for the race. A daily analysis of sports forecasts will be safer and more secure in the bank when prices are broken. We wish you success, pleasure and profit grows.",0,0,0,statistic+sport,GitHub
