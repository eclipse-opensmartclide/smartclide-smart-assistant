2294,"We want to design and implement a database in MySQL for storing the information of all athletes and their participation in the Olympic Games held over the past years. Summer Olympics have been held since 1896 (1928 for women). Of course, you are not expected to populate the database with all the athletes from all these years – just enough to answer the queries that we wish to present.  ▪ An athlete has an Athlete_id, Athlete_name, gender, country, and a birth date. ▪ Each Olympiad has the year, a season (summer or winter), the country where it took place, and the city. For example, the 2008 summer Olympic Games were held in Beijing, China. ▪ Every athlete in the database participates in at least one Olympiad. An athlete can participate in several events in one Olympiad and can, in fact, participate in more than one Olympiad. For example, Michael Armstrong participated in the swimming, diving, and water polo events. Ian Thorpe participated in the Sydney 2000 summer Olympics and won 3 gold and 2 silver medals. In Athens 2004, he won two gold, one silver and one bronze medal. ▪ An event has a sport name, event name and event type. ▪  Schedule and Result has date, event details  which athletes were scheduled to compete in which events and how they placed, and who the winner(s) of the event was (e.g., what kind of medal they were awarded). You may assume that null values are used for winners and placings until the event has been held. For example, the women’s 100 m backstroke swimming held in summer 2008 Olympics resulted in a gold medal (finished in 1st place) for Natalie Coughlin from USA in a time of 58.96. ▪ Events in the Olympics may be either individual or team events. If it is a team event, we wish to know who the members of each team were. ",14

However, authority has to send vehicle and employees to each bin location. In addition to that, none of the government so far implement any of the IoT based waste management system widely. Here, we are going to develop an IoT based waste management which can save time as well as money; moreover, it is so practical to implement. Compare to existing system, IoT based smart bin that we are going implement has a lot more features. Firstly, it has motion sensor (Accelerometer) to prevent spilling out of waste liquid and other substance when the bin fall, it can be done by alerting to authorities when the bin fall down. Secondly, IR sensor detects the amount of waste in each waste bin, so that employees can ignore the unfilled or empty bin location when they go for collecting waste. This feature definitely designed for cost effective management. Another one significant feature that we are going add in this system is separating the waste based on the nature of the waste substances with the help of moisture sensor.",17

Some examples of online advertising include ads on blogs, banner ads, cross platform ads, e-mail marketing and advertising networks.  The Internet is becoming a continuously growing source that is expanding day by day. This speedy growth has attracted many business owners to advertise their business on internet. Due to this increasing demand, the trend of online advertising companies is also on a boost. Since internet is a source to bring in more customers, online advertising is now much preferred. Online advertising uses innovative ideas to promote a business.

However, there are still significant engineering challenges to be solved before one can fully realize the benefits of self-driving cars. One such challenge is building models that reliably predict the movement of traffic agents around the AV, such as cars, cyclists, and pedestrians.  The ridesharing company Lyft started Level 5 to take on the self-driving challenge and build a full self-driving system (they’re hiring!). Their previous competition tasked participants with identifying 3D objects, an important step prior to detecting their movement. Now, they’re challenging you to predict the motion of these traffic agents.  In this competition, you’ll apply your data science skills to build motion prediction models for self-driving vehicles. You'll have access to the largest Prediction Dataset ever released to train and test your models. Your knowledge of machine learning will then be required to predict how cars, cyclists,and pedestrians move in the AV's environment.  Lyft’s mission is to improve people’s lives with the world’s best transportation. They believe in a future where self-driving cars make transportation safer, environment-friendly and more accessible for everyone. Their goal is to accelerate development across the industry by sharing data with researchers. As a result of your participation, you can have a hand in propelling the industry forward and helping people around the world benefit from self-driving cars sooner.  This is a Code Competition.

Therefore, the fine identification of the license plate, head and tail of the transport vehicle and the shape of the minerals truck load in the mining area is not only of great significance for the effective management of mine resources, but also can avoid the illegal behavior of tax evasion. In the mining environment, there are many kinds of vehicles in and out. In addition to transport vehicles, there are trucks, SUVs, buses and other types of vehicles. In addition, there are also waste resources such as ballast. Therefore, it is of great significance for the construction of mine comprehensive supervision platform to effectively identify the transport vehicles and the goods they trucker and eliminate the interference of other types of vehicles. When the mine environmental supervision system captures the photos of the head and tail of the truck, it is impossible to give the impact of tax evasion caused by the problem of the head and tail of the truck distinction. The purpose of this paper is to solve the problem that the head and tail of the mine transportation vehicle could not be identified accurately. The comparison between the head and tail images is shown in Figure1. ",38

However, increased dependence on these devices opens up new consequences and attack vectors that an adversary can use to attack a target. This is of particular importance in the case of IoT devices connected to smart grid infrastructure as cyber-attacks could be used to disrupt critical national infrastructure. Currently, many IoT devices are very susceptible to cyber-attack due to insufficient or poorly implemented security practices. This project aims to produce and model a collection of policies and protocols that are suitable for mitigating the threats that a smart grid connected IoT device may face. I wish to focus on the following goals within this project: - Investigating and conducting a risk assessment on the main vulnerabilities and threats faced by IoT devices within this scenario. - Recommend security policies that can mitigate these threats, justifying these policies taking into account secondary factors including the cost to implement and any loss to productivity these policies might incur. - Model these policies using Scyther, a formal method based protocol verification tool. The scope of this project will be investigating and modelling the best policies and procedures for IoT devices in the smart grid/energy sector.",17

3110,"# Denoising Dirty Documents Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is the process of getting type or handwritten documents into a digitized format. If you've read a classic novel on a digital reading device or had your doctor pull up old healthcare records via the hospital computer system, you've probably benefited from OCR.  OCR makes previously static content editable, searchable, and much easier to share. But, a lot of documents eager for digitization are being held back. Coffee stains, faded sun spots, dog-eared pages, and lot of wrinkles are keeping some printed documents offline and in the past.   This competition challenges you to give these documents a machine learning makeover. Given a dataset of images of scanned text that has seen better days, you're challenged to remove the noise. Improving the ease of document enhancement will help us get that rare mathematics book on our e-reader before the next beach vacation.  We've kicked off the fun with a few handy scripts to get you started on the dataset. Acknowledgements  Kaggle is hosting this competition for the machine learning community to use for fun and practice. This dataset was created by RM.J. Castro-Bleda, S. España-Boquera, J. Pastor-Pellicer, F. Zamora-Martinez. We also thank the UCI machine learning repository for hosting the dataset. If you use the problem in publication, please cite:  Bache, K. & Lichman, M. (2013).

Irvine, CA: University of California, School of Information and Computer Science  ## AIM: * To Denoise the images using Encoder-Decoder Model  ## Dataset: *  * We are provided two sets of images, train and test. These images contain various styles of text, to which synthetic noise has been added to simulate real-world, messy artifacts. The training set includes the test without the noise (train_cleaned).

Sizing turned out to be an impressive driver of our design,  given the small surface area and the necessity of having resistant systems, and the  distribution/layout of our components had to be redesigned multiple times before a  3D-printing stage.  Our project was based on many other project proposals (found on countless Maker  social media and websites), including instructables.com’s tips to power LED Strips to  Adafruit’s own tutorials for using their products.  Our approach to the software coding consisted mainly on dividing our block diagram  into minimal steps and creating chunks of algorithms for each fundamental component  of the project: e.g. we would code lighting LEDs functions and GPS coordination  functions, then write the integration for the GPS+LED orientation algorithms.",17

3259,AARemu is a software tool enabling simulation of Augmented Reality  by allowing an AR developer to record either an interactive 360 degree or a non-interactive free-form view of a location using the devices camera and orientation sensors (this functionality is provided by the ARemRecorder app). The ARCamera/ARCameraDevice  classes which provides a mock implementation of the Android Camera API classes can then be used to preview the recorded scene instead of the live camera preview provided by the Android Camera class. The preview callback is analogous to the standard Camera preview  callback except that the preview bytes provided in the callback  are extracted from a file created by the recorder application. These preview bytes are passed to the development code  via the same preview callback as provided by the standard Camera   classes and can thus be processed by Computer Vision algorithms  before being displayed by the client application. The frames are  stored as individual video frames in RGBA format  and not as video so the preview can be accessed in any direction. The tool is aimed at developers of mobile AR applications as it allows the developer to record view(s) of a given location and then debug and test the AR application in the comfort of a office or home without having to  make extensive changes to the programming  code.,22

A TAS system considers the users current context, like his location or current situation (‘working’, ‘driving by car’, ‘staying home’), weather, traffic conditions and also by querying intelligent devices (heating, car,...). It uses sensor data – events (GPS, acceleration) sent by the users smartphone to a central server and combines it with domain knowledge to be aware of relevant situations or locations and to react to complex events. CoCoTAS can be used for a large variety of scenarios, thanks to the generic architecture. In general, it was designed to execute or delegate tasks (“buy some beer on your way from work” or “inform my parents when I arrive at home”) to users, according to their current situation and by executing intelligent coordination rules on the backend-side.   CoCoTASControl is an android app and part of the CoCoTAS system. It collects, filters and sends events generated by devices like smartphones to a central coordination server.

In the essence the metadata can answer: who, what, when, where, why, and also how about every facet of data that are being documented in a machine. Metadata within a file type(can be anything) can actually tell a lot about you. Cameras can record the data about when a picture was taken and also what camera was used at the time. Office documents which are: PDF or Office automatically adds the author and the company info to the documents and also the spreadsheets. Maybe you don't want to disclose those information. That is when this data cleansing tool comes into picture . you can have all the metadata of the documents you share either randomized, anonymized or even both. This tool essentially focuses on the location, source of the data anonymization. There are many notable drawbacks to Exif metadata. The most challenging drawback is ease in which data can be manipulated and lack of audit methodology for tracking the changes to metadata. Much of media source material found on Internet will contain a very little metadata. Practically all of social networking sites now routinely strip the metadata from images that are uploaded to their websites. original reason for removing the metadata is that the Internet trolls and the stalkers were harvesting the GPS data from the images of the celebrities and the officials to determine their travel habits and then also intercepting them at the expected locations.",12

In recent years, there is a tremendous increase in the volume of non – performing loans which results in a jeopardizing effect on the growth of these institutions.  Therefore, to maintain a healthy portfolio, the banks put stringent monitoring and evaluation measures in place to ensure timely repayment of loans by borrowers. Despite these measures, a major proportion of loans become delinquent. Delinquency occurs when a borrower misses a payment against his/her loan.  Given the information like mortgage details, borrowers related details and payment details, our objective is to identify the delinquency status of loans for the next month given the delinquency status for the previous 12 months (in number of months)",13

The closed-circuit television camera (CCTV) is essential for a range of public uses in a smart city; combined with Internet of Things (IoT) technologies theycan turn into smart sensors that  help to ensure safety and security. However, the authenticity of the camera itself raises issues of building up integrity and suitability of data. In this paper,we present a blockchain-based system to guarantee  the trustworthiness of the stored recordings,allowing authorities to validate whether or not a video has  been altered. It helps to discriminate fake videos from original ones and to make sure that surveillance  cameras are authentic. Since the distributed ledger of the blockchain records the metadata of the CCTV video as well, it is obstructing the chance of forgery of the data. This immutable ledger diminishes the  risk of copyright encroachment for law enforcement agencies and clients users by securing possession  and identity...",17

5530,"Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical naming system built on distributed database. This system translates domain name to IP address or vice-versa and make it possible to assign domain name to group of internet resources and users. DNS protocol uses port 53 of UDP transport layer protocol which does not contain security by itself and does not have foolproof built in authentication making it more susceptible to hacking than other network based services. Domain Name System Security Extension (DNSSEC) are a collection of protocols that add a layer of security to the domain Name System lookup and exchange processes, which have become integral in accessing websites through the internet. It is set of extensions to DNS which provides DNS clients authentications of DNS data. The motivation for doing this project is primarily an interest in undertaking challenging project in the field of DNSSEC because during the part of the course we found the topic very interesting and hence wanted to pursue our project on this topic so that we could acquire more knowledge and experiences in this concept. In this project we  installed and configured DNS Test Bed Hierarchy by configuring Root, TLD, STLD DNS Servers for forward and reverse lookups zones. We done the evaluation on this hierarchy to check DNS query latency from the identified vantage point.  We implemented DNSSEC on DNS Test Bed Hierarchy and again done the evaluation for DNS query latency, and done the analysis to compare the query latency with DNSSEC and without DNSSEC.",6

And to find the path that achieves that time. The map is represented as a graph. Intersections are represented by nodes and roads are represented by edges. Each road has a speed (in km/h). You may assume that all the vehicles moving at the road are moving with that speed. The moving person can walk for at most R meters from the source location to get to the starting intersection. Then they ride a vehicle to move to another intersection close to the destination location. Then they can walk from the intersection to the destination location for at most R meters. The walking speed is always 5 km/h (from the source location to the nearby intersection and from the intersection near to the destination to the destination location). ",38

Detecting illegal insider trading is difficult due to the complex, nonlinear, and non-stationary nature of the stock market. In this work, we present an approach that detects and predicts illegal insider trading proactively from large heterogeneous sources of structured and unstructured data using a deep-learning based approach combined with discrete signal processing on the time series data. In addition, we use a tree-based approach that visualizes events and actions to aid analysts in their understanding of large amounts of unstructured data. Using existing data, we have discovered that our approach has a good success rate in detecting illegal insider trading patterns.

Most of the profit for banks comes from loan's interest. Loans are the core business of banks. Since most of incomes come from interest, banks have to follow strict rule and regulation for verification of loans because defaults of loans can cost huge amount of loss to banks.

There are many Schengen countries like Austria, Germany, Italy and each country has their respective embassies in non-Schengen country.

Applicant can be of three types student applicant, tourist applicant, working applicant. However, their purpose could be for many cases like transiting, tourism, education and business. Each application must have one country as their main destination/first entry in Schengen area. Each application must have details of financial status, travel insurance and travel itinerary. Visas are of three types Uniform Schengen Visa, Limited Territorial Validity Visa and National Visas. Based on their purpose and application they are granted one of visas above and visa entry type which can be single, double, multiple entry. For single entry once, applicant completes his travel the visa is deemed inactive. In case of double entry applicant can travel two times in and out of Schengen area and there is no restriction on multiple entry. ",7
